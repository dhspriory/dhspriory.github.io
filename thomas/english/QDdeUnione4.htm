    <TD align=left>Quarto quaeritur utrum in Christo sit unum tantum esse.</TD>
    <TD align=left><B>Article 4: </B>"Whether there is only one being in 
      Christ?"</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Et videtur quod non.</TD>
    <TD align=left>And it seems that there is not.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>In Christo enim est esse divinum et humanum; quae non 
      possunt esse unum, quia esse non dicitur univoce de Deo et creaturis. Ergo 
      in Christo non est tantum unum esse, sed duo. </TD>
    <TD align=left>Objection 1: For there is both a divine and a human being 
      in Christ; which cannot be one, because being is not said univocally of 
      God and creatures. Therefore, in Christ there is not only one being, but 
      two.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Praeterea, cuilibet formae respondet suum esse: aliud enim 
      est esse album, et aliud esse hominem. Sed in Christo sunt duae formae; 
      quia, cum in forma Dei esset, formam servi accepit, ut dicitur Philipp. 
      ii, non tamen formam dei deposuit. Ergo in Christo est duplex esse. </TD>
    <TD align=left>Objection 2: Further, to any form corresponds its being; 
      for it is one thing to be white, and another to be a man. But, in Christ 
      there are two forms; since, "while he was in the form of God, he took the 
      form of a slave", as is said in <I>Philippians</I>, 2:7, yet he did not 
      set aside the form of God. Therefore, in Christ there is a two-fold 
    being.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Praeterea, secundum Philosophum, in ii de Anima, vivere 
      viventibus est esse. Sed in Christo est duplex vita; scilicet humana, quae 
      fuit privata per mortem; et divina, quae per mortem privari non potuit. 
      Ergo in Christo non est tantum unum esse, sed duo.</TD>
    <TD align=left>Objection 3: Further, according to the Philosopher, in book 
      II of the <I>de Anima</I> [com. 37], in living things, living is being. 
      But there is a two-fold life in Christ; namely a human life, which he was 
      deprived of through death; and a divine life, which he could not be 
      deprived of through death. Therefore, there is not only one being in 
      Christ, but two.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Sed contra, quidquid est unum simpliciter est unum secundum 
      esse. Sed Christus est unum simpliciter, ut supra habitum est. Ergo in eo 
      est unum esse.</TD>
    <TD align=left><B>To the contrary,</B> whatever is one simply is only one 
      being. But, Christ is one simply, as was said above. Therefore, there is 
      only one being in him.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Respondeo. Dicendum quod huius quaestionis est quodammodo 
      eadem ratio et praemissae; quia ex eodem dicitur aliquid esse unum, et 
      ens. Esse enim proprie et vere dicitur de supposito subsistente. 
      Accidentia enim et formae non subsistentes dicuntur esse, in quantum eis 
      aliquid subsistit; sicut albedo dicitur ens, in quantum ea est aliquid 
      album. Considerandum est autem, quod aliquae formae sunt quibus est 
      aliquid ens non simpliciter, sed secundum quid; sicut sunt omnes formae 
      accidentales. Aliquae autem formae sunt quibus res subsistens simpliciter 
      habet esse; quia videlicet constituunt esse substantiale rei subsistentis. 
      In Christo autem suppositum subsistens est persona Filii Dei, quae 
      simpliciter substantificatur per naturam divinam, non autem simpliciter 
      substantificatur per naturam humanam. Quia persona Filii Dei fuit ante 
      humanitatem assumptam, nec in aliquo persona est augmentata, seu 
      perfectior, per naturam humanam assumptam. Substantificatur autem 
      suppositum aeternum per naturam humanam, in quantum est hic homo. Et ideo 
      sicut Christus est unum simpliciter propter unitatem suppositi, et duo 
      secundum quid propter duas naturas, ita habet unum esse simpliciter 
      propter unum esse aeternum aeterni suppositi. Est autem et aliud esse 
      huius suppositi, non in quantum est aeternum, sed in quantum est 
      temporaliter homo factum. Quod esse, etsi non sit esse accidentale - quia 
      homo non praedicatur accidentaliter de Filio Dei, ut supra habitum est - 
      non tamen est esse principale sui suppositi, sed secundarium. Si autem in 
      Christo essent duo supposita, tunc utrumque suppositum haberet proprium 
      esse sibi principale. Et sic in Christo esset simpliciter duplex esse.</TD>
    <TD align=left><B>I answer that</B> in a certain measure solution of this 
      question and the previous one is the same; because something is said to be 
      one [esse unum] and to be a being [ens] from the same thing. For being 
      [esse] is truly and properly said of the subsisting suppositum. For 
      accidents and non-subsisting forms are said to be insofar as something 
      subsists by means of them; just as whiteness is called a being, insofar as 
      something is white by means of it. Now we should consider that there are 
      some forms by which something is a being, not simply, but in a certain 
      respect; [and] such are all accidental forms. But, there are some forms by 
      which a subsisting thing has being simply; because, obviously, they 
      constitute the substantial being of the subsisting thing. Now in Christ 
      the subsisting suppositum is the person of the Son of God, which is made a 
      substance simply through the divine nature, but it is not made a substance 
      simply through the human nature; since the person of the Son of God 
      existed before he assumed humanity, nor was he increased or perfected 
      through having assumed a human nature. But, the eternal suppositum is made 
      a substance through the human nature insofar as it is this man. And thus 
      just as Christ is one simply on account of the unity of the suppositum, 
      and two in a certain respect on account of the two natures, so he has one 
      being simply on account of the one being of the eternal suppositum. But, 
      there is also another being of this suppositum, not insofar as it is 
      eternal, but insofar as it became a man in time. That being, even if it is 
      not an accidental being, because man is not accidentally predicated of the 
      Son of God, as was said above [art. 1] - nevertheless, it is not the 
      principle being of its suppositum, but [its] secondary [being]. Now if 
      there were two supposita in Christ, then each suppositum would have its 
      own principle being. And thus there would be a two-fold being in Christ 
      simply.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Ad primum ergo dicendum quod esse humanae naturae non est 
      esse divinae. Nec tamen simpliciter dicendum est quod Christus sit duo 
      secundum esse; quia non ex aequo respicit utrumque esse suppositum 
      aeternum.</TD>
    <TD align=left>1. The being of the human nature is not the being of the 
      divine nature. Yet we cannot say simply that Christ is two with regard to 
      being; because each case does not relate in an equal way to the eternal 
      suppositum.</TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left>Et similiter etiam dicendum est ad alia. </TD>
    <TD align=left>And we must reply similarly to the other 
    objections.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><FONT size=4><A
