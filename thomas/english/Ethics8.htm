<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">After the previous discussions we must pass on to a consideration of friendship, for it is a kind of virtue
or at least accompanies virtue.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Besides, friendship is especially necessary for living, to the extent that no one, even though he had all
other goods would choose to live without friends. Indeed the rich, the rulers and the powerful seem to
need friends most of all. What purpose do goods of fortune serve if not for the beneficence which is
especially and most laudably exercised towards friends? Or how will goods of fortune be preserved and
retained without friends? For the greater they are the less secure they become. In poverty and other
misfortunes people consider friends their only refuge. Likewise friendship helps young men to guard
against wrongdoing; it helps old men to support their deficiencies and faltering movements arising from
weakness. Friendship is even useful to people in their prime for the performance of good actions, since
two persons working together either in intellectual endeavor or external activity are more effective.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">By nature the parent feels friendship for its offspring not only among men but also among birds and many
other animals. There is also friendship among people who are of the same race with one another, and
notably among men in general. Hence we have praise for lovers of their fellow men. Even when traveling
abroad we see that every man is a familiar and a friend of every other man.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">States, it seems, are maintained by friendship; and legislators are more zealous about it than about justice.
This is evident from the similarity between friendship and concord; but legislators most of all wish to
encourage concord and to expel discord as an enemy of the state.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">If people are friends there is no need of justice, but just men do need friendship. Likewise what is just
seems to be especially favorable to friendship.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Friendship is not only necessary but also noble. We praise those who love their friends; and a multiplicity
of friendships seem to be a good thing. People even identify good men and friends.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.495833in; margin-left: 0.495833in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He presents an obvious doubt.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">On this subject not a few things are uncertain. Some philosophers contend that friendship is a kind of
likeness, and that friends are like one another. Hence the saying: &#8220;Like seeks like,&#8221; &#8220;Birds of a feather
flock together,&#8221; and other proverbs of this sort. Others, on the contrary, hold that all similar individuals
are mutually opposed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Likewise some seek less superficial reasons, those more rooted in nature. Euripides, for instance,
maintained that the parched earth longs for rain and when majestic heaven is filled with rain, it longs to
fall on the earth. Heraclitus held that contrary contributes to contrary, that the most excellent harmony
results from opposites, and that all things have their origin from strife. But others were of a contrary
opinion, especially Empedocles who contended that like desires like.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Certainly questions belonging to cosmology should be passed over as not pertinent to our present
purpose. But we must give our attention to whatever subjects are human and refer to man&#8217;s morals and
passions. Thus, whether all men are capable of friendship or whether evil men can be friends, and
whether friendship is of one kind or many kinds.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.495833in; margin-left: 0.495833in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He rejects an error. &#8212; 1549-1550</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In fact some philosophers thought that there was only one kind of friendship because it is susceptible of
more and less; they did not accept the sufficient indication that things which differ in species admit of
more and less. But we have treated these matters before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1538. After the Philosopher has determined the moral and intellectual virtues and continence, which is
something imperfect in the genus of virtue, he now turns his attention to friendship which is founded
upon virtue as an effect of it. First he explains by way of introduction what he intends to do. Then [Lect.
2], at &#8220;Perhaps these questions etc.&#8221; (B. 1155 b 17), he begins to treat friendship. He develops the first
point in two ways. First [1] he shows that it pertains to ethics to treat friendship. Next [2], at &#8220;On this
subject etc.,&#8221; he shows what matters are to be treated in the question of friendship. In regard to the first
item he offers six reasons to explain what we must consider about friendship. He states first what has to
be treated, after the previous discussions, in examining the subject of friendship, viz., we must consider
the things pertaining to the study of moral philosophy, omitting what belongs to the field of the
cosmologist. The first reason [1, a] why we must investigate friendship is that the consideration of virtue
is the concern of moral philosophy. Friendship is a kind of virtue inasmuch as it is a habit of free
choice&#8212;this will be explained later (1559, 1602-1604, 1645, 1831). Also it is reduced to the genus of
justice as offering something proportional (a point that will also be discussed later), or at least it
accompanies virtue insofar as virtue is the cause of true friendship,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1539. He gives the second reason [1, b] at &#8220;Besides, friendship.&#8221; Moral philosophy considers all things
that are required for human living; and among these friendship is especially necessary, to such an extent
that no one in his right mind would choose to live in the possession of great external goods without
friends. Indeed friends seem most necessary for the wealthy, the rulers, and the powerful, who have
abundant external goods. First, for the enjoyment of these goods; there is no advantage to be derived from
goods of fortune if no one can be benefited by them, but a benefit is especially and most laudably done
for friends. Second, for the preservation of such goods that cannot be retained without friends. The
greater the goods of fortune, the less secure they are because many people secretly covet them. Nor are
friends useful only in good fortune but also in adversity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1540. Therefore, in poverty people look upon friends as the one refuge. So then in any situation friends
are needed. Likewise friendship is necessary for young men that the help of friends may restrain them
from sin, for they themselves are inclined to desires for pleasures, as has been already remarked in the
seventh book (1531). On the other hand, friends are useful to the old for assistance in their bodily
infirmities; because they are faltering in their movements from weakness, friends are needed to assist
them. But even to those who are at their peak, in the very prime of life, friends are useful for the
performance of good actions. When two work together, they are more effective. This is true both in
rational investigation where one sees &#8216;what the other cannot see, and external activity in which one is
especially a help to the other. Thus it is evident that we must investigate friendship as a state necessary
for all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1541. He presents his third reason [1, c] at &#8220;By nature the parent.&#8221; By nature a parent feels friendship
for its child. This is true not only of mankind but even of birds who obviously spend a long time training
their young. And the same goes for other animals. There is also a natural friendship between people of
the same race who have common customs and social life. There is above all that natural friendship of all
men for one another by reason of their likeness in specific nature. For this reason we praise
philanthropists or friends of mankind as, fulfilling what is natural to man. This: is evident when a man
loses his way; for everyone stops even an unknown stranger from taking the wrong road, as if every man
is naturally a familiar and a friend of every other man. But those things which are naturally good must
be treated by the moralist. Therefore he ought to treat friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1542. At &#8220;States, it seems&#8221; [1, d] he offers the fourth reason, pointing out that states seem to be preserved
by friendship. Hence legislators have greater zeal for maintaining friendship among citizens than even
justice itself which is sometimes omitted, for example, in the infliction of punishment, lest dissension
be stirred up. This is clear from the fact that concord and friendship are similar. Certainly lawmakers
especially want this harmony and eliminate from the citizenry as much as possible contention inimical
to the security of the state. Because the whole of ethics seems to be ordered to the good of the state, as
was said at the beginning (25), it pertains to ethics to treat friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1543. He states the fifth reason [1, e] at &#8220;If people,&#8221; saying that if men are friends there should be no
need of justice in the strict sense because they should have all things in common; a friend is another self
and there is no justice to oneself. But if men are just they nevertheless need friendship for one another.
Likewise perfect justice seems to preserve and restore friendship. Therefore it pertains to ethics to treat
friendship much more than justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1544 . He gives the sixth reason [1, f] at &#8220;But friendship&#8221; explaining that we must treat friendship not
only because it is something necessary for human living but also because it is something good, i.e.,
laudable and honorable. We praise <i>philophiloi</i>, i.e., those who love their friends; and <i>poliphilia</i> (a
multiplicity of friendships) seems to be so good that people identify good men and friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1545. Then [2], at &#8220;On this subject,&#8221; he shows what should be considered on friendship. First [2, a] he
presents an obvious doubt about friendship. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Certainly questions etc.,&#8221; he shows the kind
of doubts to be resolved about friendship. Last [2, c], at &#8220;In fact some etc.,&#8221; he rejects an error of certain
philosophers. He considers the first point in a twofold manner. First [a, i] he states conflicting opinions
of some thinkers on friendship in human affairs; second [a, ii], at &#8220;Likewise some etc.,&#8221; on friendship
in things of nature. He says first that not a few things regarding friendship are uncertain. This is obvious,
primarily from the diversity of opinions. Some contend that friendship is a kind of likeness and that like
people are friends of one another. In favor of this they quote proverbs: &#8220;Like seeks like,&#8221; &#8220;Birds of a
feather flock together.&#8221; Certain birds like starlings do flock together. There are other proverbs of this
type. But others, on the contrary, hold that all potters are enemies of each other, since one hinders
another&#8217;s gain. But the truth of the matter is that, essentially speaking, like is lovable; it is, however,
hateful incidentally, precisely as an impediment to one&#8217;s own good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1546. At &#8220;Likewise some&#8221; [a, ii] he states conflicting opinions about the same subject in things of nature.
He says that on this very question some seek loftier, i.e., deeper reasons, more in the manner of
cosmologists. Thus Euripides maintained that the parched earth desires rain as if loving its contrary; and
that when heaven, worthy of honor on account of its excellence, is filled with rain its longs to fall on the
earth, i.e., to send down rain to earth, which is the contrary of its loftiness and fullness. Likewise
Heraclitus held that contrary contributes to contrary, as cold things to a man suffering from excessive
heat, insofar as the most excellent harmony or equilibrium is produced from different and contrary things.
But he said that the contrary does this inasmuch as all things had their origin from strife by means of
which the elements, mingled in the beginning, are separated. But others like Empedocles were of an
opposite opinion: that like desires like.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1547. Our difficulty is answered: essentially speaking, like is desirable naturally; but incidentally like
desires the contrary, inasmuch as it is helpful and medicinal. Cf. his previous discussion on bodily
pleasures (1525-1517).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1548. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Certainly questions,&#8221; he shows the kinds of doubts to be resolved about friendship,
saying that cosmological questions must be omitted as irrelevant to our present purpose. Attention should
be directed to human affairs as connected with morals and man&#8217;s passions; for instance, whether all men
are capable of friendship, or whether evil men are incapable of it, and whether there is one kind or many
kinds of friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1549. Then [2, c], at &#8220;In fact some,&#8221; he rejects an error of some philosophers who thought there was only
one kind of friendship because all species of friendship are to be compared according to more and less.
Thus we say that honorable friendship is greater than useful friendship. But Aristotle says that they have
not accepted the adequate explanation that even those things that differ specifically receive more and less
inasmuch as they agree generically. For example, we may say that white has more color than black, or
by analogy that act is more excellent than potency, and substance than accident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1550- In conclusion he says that the things just treated pertaining to human activities in regard to
friendship were discussed previously in a general way.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Perhaps these questions will be clarified by some knowledge about what is lovable, for it seems that man
does not love everything but only what is lovable; and this is either a good in itself or a good that is
pleasurable or useful. But the useful good seems to be a means of attaining the good in itself or the
pleasurable good. Therefore, the good in itself and the pleasurable will be things lovable as ends.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">While there are three motives prompting love, certainly the love of inanimate objects is not called
friendship. In it there is neither a mutual return nor a will for the good of the objects. Indeed it would be
absurd to wish good to wine, although a man does want it to remain unspoiled so he can have it. On the
other hand, we say that the good of a friend must be wished for his sake.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, it is necessary for friendship that men wish good to one another, that this fact be recognized
by each, and that it be for the sake of one of the reasons previously mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1551. After the Philosopher has shown in the introduction that it is necessary to clarify friendship and
what things are to be determined about it, now he begins to treat friendship. First [A] he explains what
friendship is. Then [Lect. 3], at &#8220;Since these objects etc.&#8221; (1156 a 5), he distinguishes its kinds. Last
[Lect. 1, Bk IX], at &#8220;In all friendships etc.&#8221; (1163 b 32), he states the properties belonging to the different
kinds of friendship. He treats</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">the first point from two aspects. First [A, 1] he investigates the four parts of the definition of friendship.
Next [A, 2], at &#8220;Therefore it is necessary etc., he concludes with the definition of friendship. First [1, a]
he investigates the portion dealing with the object. In regard to this he does three things. First [a, i] he
determines the object of friendship. Second [a, ii], at &#8220;Do men then love etc.,&#8221; he raises a doubt. Third
[a, iii], at &#8220;it seems though etc.,&#8221; he gives the answer. He says first that these questions will perhaps be
somewhat clarified if we understand the nature of the thing that is lovable, the object of love from which
friendship (or love) receives its name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1552. Not everything is loved indiscriminately because evil as such is not loved, but man loves what is
lovable, and this is either good in itself, i.e., honorable, or it is a pleasurable or useful good. The last or
useful good seems to be a means of attaining the honorable and pleasurable goods which are lovable on
account of themselves as ends. On the other hand, useful good is lovable on account of another, as a
means to an end. But the good and the pleasurable taken in general are not distinguished from one
another in substance but only in concept. Something is described as good precisely insofar as it is
intrinsically perfect and desirable; and pleasurable inasmuch as the appetite rests in it. However that is
not the meaning here: the question here is of man&#8217;s genuine good, which belongs to reason; and the
pleasurable is taken here as that which appeals to the senses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1553. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;Do men then love, he raises a. doubt on this point: do men love what is the absolute
good, or what is good relative to themselves? These sometimes do differ from each other. For instance,
to philosophize in itself is good but not in the case of the pauper. The same doubt presents itself in the
case of the pleasurable good itself; for an object pleasurable in itself (e.g., a sweet) is not pleasant to one
with a sour taste.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1554. At &#8220;It seems though&#8221; [a, iii] he answers the foregoing question. First [iii, x] he states his solution,
saying everyone seems to love what is good for him because every faculty tends to the object
proportionate to itself. Thus everyone&#8217;s vision sees what is visible to it. As the totally lovable is the
totally good, so the lovable for each man is that which is good for him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1555. Second [iii, y], at &#8220;However, everyone,&#8221; he argues for the contrary, saying that every man loves
not what is really good for him but what seems good for him; for desire tends to an object only as
apprehended. Consequently it seems false that what is lovable is what is good for him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1556. Third [iii, z], at &#8220;But this makes,&#8221; he gives the answer that this makes no difference to our
proposition; for, when some apparent good is loved it is loved as a good for oneself. Hence it can also
be said that what is lovable is what appears good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1557. The second portion which he gives at &#8220;While there are&#8221; [i, b], relates to the quality of love. He says
that while there are three reasons why men love, viz., the good, the pleasurable, and the useful, friendship
does not consist in that love which a man is said to have for inanimate things, like wine or gold. He
shows this in two ways. First, because in a love of this kind there cannot be the mutual return that is
necessary for friendship, for wine does not love man as man loves wine. Second, because we do not love
inanimate things in such a way that we will their good. It would be absurd to say that we willed good to
wine; but the good which is wine a man wills for himself. Therefore, in loving wine man obviously does
not have benevolence towards the wine but towards himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1558. If someone says that a man wishes good to the wine because he wishes that it be preserved, we
should consider that a man wants the wine to remain unspoiled so he can have it. In this way he does not
desire the preservation of the wine for the good of the wine but for his own good. And this is contrary
to the notion of friendship, for we say that the good of a friend must be willed for his sake and not for
the sake of the one loving.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1559. The third portion [i, c], which he presents at &#8220;But those wishing,&#8221; refers to change in the one loved.
He explains that when people wish good to someone for his sake we call them benevolent but not friends
if the wish is not reciprocated so that the loved one wishes good to, and for the sake of, the one loving.
The reason is that we say friendship is benevolence with corresponding requital inasmuch as the one
loving is loved in return, for friendship has a kind of exchange of love after the manner of commutative
justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1560. The fourth portion [r, d] is taken from the condition for mutual love; and it is stated at &#8220;Likewise
we must.&#8221; He says that to complete the notion of friendship we must add that it is a mutual benevolence
which is recognized. Many men are benevolent towards those they have never seen, for, from reports,
they judge these people are just, i.e., virtuous, or useful to themselves. Likewise it is possible that one
of them should have the same feeling towards him who is benevolent in this way. Consequently men of
this kind seem to be benevolent towards one another but cannot be friends while they are unaware of one
another&#8217;s feelings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">156z. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;Therefore it is necessary,&#8221; he concludes with the definition of friendship derived
from the premises. He says that it is necessary to the notion of friendship that men wish good to one
another, that this fact be recognized by them, and that it be for the sake of one of the things previously
mentioned, namely, the good, the pleasurable, or the useful.</span></p>

love.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, of those who love one another for utility, one does not love the other for the other&#8217;s sake but
for the good they mutually gain. The same is true of those who love each other for pleasure, for friends
like these do not love witty people because of their character but because they are pleasant companions.
Both those who love for utility love for the good they get and those who love for the sake of pleasantness
love for the pleasure they enjoy. These do not love a friend because he is a friend but because he is useful
or pleasant. Therefore, these friendships are incidental, for a man is loved not for what he is but for some
advantage or pleasure.</span></p>

are loved cease to be pleasant or useful, their friends stop loving them. But the useful is not permanent
but is one thing now and then another. Consequently if the reason for friendship no longer exists, the
friendship itself is dissolved.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1562. After the Philosopher has shown the nature of friendship, he now distinguishes the kinds of
friendship. On this point he does two things. First he makes his distinction. Then [Lect. 13], at &#8220;There
are three etc.&#8221; (B.1162 a 34), he shows which kinds of friendship give rise to complaints or grumblings.
He treats his first point from two aspects. First he distinguishes the kinds of friendship which exist
between persons of equal rank. Next [Lect. 7], at &#8220;There is another etc.&#8221; (B. 1158 b 11), he distinguishes
the kinds of friendship that exist between persons of unequal rank. On the first point he does two things.
First he distinguishes the kinds of friendship. Second [Lect. 6], at &#8220;Consequently, the friendships etc.&#8221;
(B 1158 b), he shows, that these consist in equality. He -discusses the first point from three aspects. First
[I] he distinguishes the kinds of friendship. Then [Lect. 5; II], at &#8220;Just as in the case etc.&#8221; (B.1157 b 5),
he treats them in relation to their acts. Last [Lect. 6; III], at &#8220;But friendship etc.&#8221; (B. 1158 a 3), he treats
them in relation to their subjects. On the first point [I, A] he gives the distinction of the kinds. Next [I,
B], at &#8220;Therefore of those etc.,&#8221; he treats the particular kinds.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1563. He says first that there are three kinds of lovable objects, is indicated (1552, 1557), namely, the
good as such, the pleasurable, and the useful; these do not differ in kind as three equal species of a genus
but are classified by priority and posteriority. Since acts are diversified according to the difference of
objects, the types of love will differ in kind according to these three: thus there is one type of love by
which a thing is loved for the good, another for the pleasurable, and a third for the useful. Likewise,
because love is an act of friendship, there will be three kinds of friendship equal to the three objects of
love. One is friendship for the honorable good or the good as such, another for the pleasurable, and a
third for the useful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1564. In each of these the definition of friendship just given is fulfilled, because in each of the three a
recognized return of love by someone is possible. Likewise in these three, people can will good to one
another according to their love. For example, if men love for the sake of virtue, they wish one another
the virtuous good; but if for a good based on utility, they wish one another useful goods; if for a good
based on pleasure they wish pleasurable goods.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1565. Next [l, B], at &#8220;Therefore of those,&#8221; he treats the kinds of friendship just mentioned which are
contained under friendship not according to equality but according to priority and posteriority. So he does
three things. First [B, i] he treats friendship based on utility and that based on pleasure which share the
nature of friendship by posteriority. Then [B, 2], at &#8220;Perfect friendship, however etc.,&#8221; he treats
friendship based on the honorable, i.e., good by itself to which the notion of friendship primarily and
essentially pertains. Last [B, 3; Lect. 4], at &#8220;But that etc.&#8221; (B. 1157), he compares the other kinds of
friendship with this kind. He discusses the first point from two aspects. First [i, a] he shows just what the
different kinds of imperfect friendship are; then [i, b], at &#8220;This friendship,&#8221; to whom they belong. On the
first point he does two things. First [a, i] he shows that useful and pleasurable friendships are friendships
in an incidental sense. Second [a, ii], at &#8220;Since men etc.,&#8221; he shows that they are easily dissolved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1566. He says first that of those who love one another for the sake of utility, one does not love the other
for the sake of the other but inasmuch as he receives from the other some good for himself. The same is
true of those who love each other on account of pleasantness, for the one does not love the other precisely
as witty or virtuous in merriment but merely as pleasant to himself. So it is obvious that those who love
for the sake of utility love for the good they get, and those who love for the sake of pleasantness love for
the pleasure they enjoy. Thus they do not love their friend for what he is in himself but for what is
incidental to him, his utility or pleasantness. Therefore, friendships of this sort plainly are not friendships
essentially but incidentally, because a person is not loved for what he is but for utility or pleasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1567. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;Since men,&#8221; he shows that friendships of this kind are easily dissolved. They are
for the sake of something that is incidental to the persons loved and in this men do not always remain the
same. The same man, for instance, is not always pleasant or useful. Therefore, when those who are loved
cease to be pleasant or useful, their friends stop loving them. This is very obvious in friendship based on
utility, for the same thing is not always useful to a man. it is one thing now, and then another in different
times and places. So a doctor is useful for sickness, a sailor for navigation and so on. Since then
friendship was cultivated not for the man himself but for the utility he afforded, when the cause of the
friendship vanishes the friendship too is consequently dissolved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1568. At &#8220;This friendship&#8221; [1, b] he shows to whom these friendships may be attributed. First [1, b, i]
he shows to whom useful friendships belong; then [1, b, ii], at &#8220;Young men seem etc.,&#8221; to whom
pleasurable friendship. He notes three classes of men who avail themselves of useful friendship. First [i,
x] he says that this friendship seems to exist especially among old men who are not looking for what is
pleasurable for the delight of body and sensitive nature, but rather what is useful for help needed for their
natural deficiency.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1569. Second [i, y], at &#8220;It is also,&#8221; he says that is the kind of friendship pursued by adolescents and
youths who seek what is useful. They seem quite incapable of possessing mutual love or even of
remaining constant companions because sometimes they are not agreeable to one another; neither does
one need the companionship of another except for utility. Their association with one another is
pleasurable to them inasmuch as it holds some hope of good for which this association is useful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">157o. Third [i, z], at &#8220;To the same,&#8221; he says that to friendships based on utility some reduce even the
friendship of fellow travelers who seem to love one another for the advantage that one derives from
another on his journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1571. Next [1, b, ii], at &#8220;Young men seem,&#8221; he shows to whom pleasurable friendship may be attributed.
On this point he does two things. First [ii, x] he explains to whom this friendship may be assigned, saying
that friendship based on pleasure belongs most of all to youths. This is so because they live according
to the impulses of passion since they have not been strengthened in rational judgment by which the
passions are regulated. Because all passions terminate at pleasure and pain, as we stated in the second
book (296, 441), youths principally seek what is pleasurable at the present moment. The passions belong
to the sensitive part of man which is chiefly concerned with the present. But to love a present thing
because it is productive of future pleasure coincides with the notion of the useful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1572. Then [ii, y], at &#8220;As they grow older,&#8221; he shows that these friendships readily change in two ways:
first [y, aa], on the part of the pleasurable objects, because other things become pleasing to them with
the passing of time. It is not in the same thing that children, adolescents, and youths alike find pleasure;
and so they easily make friends and easily forsake them because with the change of pleasure comes a
change of friendship. But youthful pleasure is characteristically swift to change since the nature of youth
consists wholly in a state of change.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1573. At &#8220;Moreover, young people&#8221; [y, bb] he shows the same thing on the part of those who love. He
says that young people are volatile, i.e., quick and vehement in their love because they love not from
rational choice but from passion and inasmuch as they are very desirous of pleasure. Therefore they love
passionately and intensely. Since passion vanishes as quickly as it appears, such persons as easily fall
in love as they cease to love; many times they even fall in and out of love the same day. But as long as
the friendship endures these people want to remain together all day long and live in the other&#8217;s presence
inasmuch as they enjoy the company of each other. This is the way their friendship works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1574. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;Perfect friendship, however,&#8221; he treats the principal kind of friendship which is
for the good of virtue. First [2, a] he points out that this friendship is perfect. He says that the friendship
between good men and those alike in virtue is perfect friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1575. Then [2, b], at &#8220;for those who,&#8221; he proves his statement by~ explaining the qualities of this
friendship. First [2, b, i] he shows that this is friendship essentially and not incidentally. Second [2, b,
ii], at &#8220;Likewise each,&#8221; he shows that it lacks nothing. Third [2, b, iii], at &#8220;Very likely etc.,&#8221; he shows
that it is rare. He handles the first point in a threefold manner. First [2, b, i, x] he shows that the
friendship just referred to is friendship essentially and not incidentally. Those who are alike in virtue
wish one another good inasmuch as they are virtuous. But they are good in themselves, for virtue is a
kind of perfection making man good and his work good. It is clear then that such men wish good to one&#8217;
another in themselves. Therefore they have friendship essentially.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1576. Second [2, b, i, y], at &#8220;But people who,&#8221; he concludes from this that friendship of this type is the
best friendship; that which is essential is always better than that which is incidental. Since this is
friendship essentially and the others incidentally, the virtuous who wish good to friends for their sake
and not for the sake of something that may come from them are the highest type of friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1577. Third [2, b, i, z], at &#8220;Therefore friendship,&#8221; he infers further: from the fact that men of this kind
love one another by reason of their goodness, their friendship consequently remains as long as they are
good in virtue. But virtue is a permanent habit and does not change easily, as is clear from discussions
in the second book (305). Therefore this friendship is lasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1578. At &#8220;Likewise each&#8221; [2, b, ii] he shows that this friendship lacks nothing that belongs to the notion
of what is perfect, as is evident in the third book of the <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 6, 207 a 10; St. Th. Lect. 11, 385).
On the first point he does three things. First [2, b, ii, x] he shows that this friendship comprehends those
things that are found in other kinds of friendship. He explains that each friend is good not only simply
or in himself but also in relation to his friend, because those who are virtuous are also good without
qualification and useful to one another and completely pleasing. This is so because each man takes
pleasure in his own actions and in actions similar to his own. Likewise the actions of virtuous men are
those belonging to one man as proper to him and to another as similar to these; for operations that are
according to virtue are not contrary to each other but all are according to right reason. So then it is
obvious that the friendship of virtuous men comprehends not only good in an unqualified sense but also
pleasure and utility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1579. Then [2, b, ii, y], at &#8220;It is reasonable,&#8221; he concludes further that it is reasonable for such friendship
to be long lasting and not readily transient, because it contains absolutely everything necessary for
friends. Every friendship is for the sake of good or pleasure: either in itself (for example, when what is
loved is in itself good and pleasurable) or in relation to the one loving which is to be good and
pleasurable not in itself and properly but according to a kind of likeness to what is really and properly
good and pleasurable. in fact all the preceding things are found in this friendship not incidentally but
essentially; and those who are alike according to this friendship have the remaining goods too, because
what is simply good is also pleasing. Since this friendship has all the requisites of friendship, it is not
easily broken up, for a defective thing is usually set aside.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">i58o. His third conclusion [2, b, ii, z], at &#8220;These things then,&#8221; observes that this friendship is the noblest
kind because the state in which all the reasons for loving are united is most lovable. Objects of this kind
are honorable goods because they are good without qualification and at the same time pleasurable and
useful. Hence love in these cases should be most complete, and such friendship the noblest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1581. Next [2, b, iii], at &#8220;Very likely,&#8221; he shows that this friendship is rare-an indication of its perfection,
for perfection in any class is rather unusual. On this point he does three things. First [iii, x] he explains
his intention. Then [iii, y], at &#8220;However, those who etc.,&#8221; he excludes an objection. Last [iii, z], at &#8220;A
friendship of this kind then etc.,&#8221; he gives a summary. He explains his intention by two reasons. The first
[x, aa] is that this friendship exists between virtuous men. But such men are scarce because of the
difficulty of attaining the mean, as was pointed out in the second book (370). Consequently it is very
likely that such friendships are rare.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1582. Then [x, bb], at &#8220;Besides, time,&#8221; be gives the second reason. Friendship between men of this kind
requires a long time and mutual association so that they can decide among themselves who are virtuous
and their friends. This is so because, according to the proverb, people do not come to know one another
before they eat a peck of salt together. But one man ought not to take another as his friend until he
appears to the other worthy of being loved and is believed to be so. This rarely occurs. Consequently such
friendships are uncommon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1583. Next [iii, y], at &#8220;However, those who,&#8221; he excludes an objection concerning those who seem to
become friends at once. He says that people who quickly offer the services of friendship show that they
want to be friends; nevertheless they are not yet friends until they know that they are lovable to one
another. Thus it is clear that a man quickly acquires a wish for friendship but not friendship itself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1584. Last [iii, z], at &#8220;A friendship of this kind,&#8221; he concludes with a summary that this friendship is
perfect both in regard to duration because it is lasting, and in regard to the other conditions. It contains
everything found in the other kinds of friendship; and friends perform like services for each other&#8212;a
thing that is necessary for friendship because friends are alike in virtue.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But here again friendships are to a great extent lasting when an equal return, of pleasure for instance, is
made by each friend; and not only by a return of pleasure, but also by a return of the same pleasurable
object, as happens among the witty. This does not occur between a lover and his beloved, however, for
they do not take pleasure in the same things: one in seeing the beloved, the other in receiving the
attention of the lover. But when beauty fades, the friendship sometimes breaks up, because the lover is
no longer attracted by the beloved and the other no longer receives the adulation of the lover.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Likewise, people who are friends by reason of utility break up their friendship when utility ends because
they were not lovers of one another but only of profit.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, for the sake of pleasure and utility bad people may be friends to one another, or good men may
be friends to bad men; and those who are neither good nor bad may be friends with any sort of person.
But it is plain that only virtuous men love each other because of themselves, for vicious men do not find
pleasure in one another unless some advantage is forthcoming.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Only the friendship between virtuous men is unchangeable. For it is not easy to believe some evil about
a person who often has been proved and never found acting unjustly, and in whom we have discovered
whatever is considered worthy of true friendship. But in other types of friendship there is nothing to
prevent all such kinds of suspicions from occurring. Indeed men designate as friends both those who love
for utility, like alliances between states which seem to be contracted with a view to advantage, and those
who love for pleasure, like children. Consequently we too should call men of this sort friends.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There are then many kinds of friendship. First and principally is the friendship between good men qua
good. The remaining types are called friendship by analogy, for some men are friends in virtue of
something good or something akin to good; even what is pleasurable seems to be good to those who are
fond of pleasures. But these friendships do not combine very well nor do the same persons become
friends from motives of utility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Things that are incidental are not bound together in all respects. But friendship is divided into these
species: evil men can be friends for pleasure or utility, this being their point of resemblance. On the other
hand, good men are friends for one another&#8217;s sake, i.e., in virtue of their goodness. The good then are
friends in an absolute sense, but the others only incidentally and because of their resemblance to the
good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1585. After the Philosopher has treated the three kinds of friendship, he now [B, 3] compares them. On
this point he does three things. First [3, a] he shows in what respect the other kinds of friendship are like
perfect friendship. Then [3, b], at &#8220;Therefore, for the sake etc.,&#8221; he shows how they differ. Last [3, c],
at &#8220;There are then etc.,&#8221; he summarizes what has been discussed. He treats the first point in a twofold
manner. First [a, i] he shows the likeness of the other kinds of friendship with perfect friendship in regard
to the reason for loving. He explains that friendship for pleasure has a likeness to perfect friendship to
the extent that virtuous men are pleasing to one another. Similarly, utilitarian friendship is like perfect
friendship in this that virtuous men are useful to one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1586. Second [a, ii], at &#8220;But here again,&#8221; he shows the likeness in regard to the duration of friendship.
On this point he does two things. First [ii, x] he shows how useful and pleasurable friendships endure.
Next [ii, y], at &#8220;Likewise, people who etc.,&#8221; he shows which of these is more enduring. He discusses the
first point from a double aspect. First [x, aa] he proposes two reasons why these two kinds of friendship
are lasting; and in this they resemble perfect friendship. Then [x, bb], at &#8220;Where people etc.,&#8221; he states
the reasons why they lack permanency. Initially [aa, a] he says that friendships even among those who
are friends for utility and pleasure endure for the most part, since such persons make the same and an
equal return to one another, for example, pleasure for pleasure. Because there is a variety of pleasures
differing in kind and number according to the variety of pleasurable objects, the durability of friendship
requires not only a return of pleasure but a return by the same kind of pleasurable object; this occurs
among the witty, when one delights in the banter of the other. But this does not necessarily happen
among persons who love one another sexually, since sometimes they do not take pleasure in the same
things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1587. But the lover takes pleasure in seeing the beauty of the beloved; and the beloved in receiving favors
from the lover. On the termination of these circumstances, pleasurable friendship sometimes breaks up
when the attractiveness of the one and the favor of the other cease.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1588. At &#8220;Again, many persons etc.&#8221; [aa, b&#8217;] he gives tile second reason for durability. . fie explains that
even in friendship based on utility and pleasure many remain friends when one loves the ways of the
other, like one lustful person loves the ways of another, or one miser loves the ways of another; not that
such ways are attractive of themselves but by reason of habit inasmuch as both persons have like habits.
But likeness is essentially a cause of friendship unless it incidentally hinders the good of the individual,
as we stated previously (1566). Since evil habits acquired from custom are enduring, such a friendship
is lasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1589. Then [x, bb], at &#8220;Where people,&#8221; he states the reason why friendship is deficient in durability. He
says that people who do not make a return of one pleasurable object for another but of a useful object
for a pleasurable one are less friends because of slighter likeness to one another. Hence their friendship
is less enduring.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1590. Next [ii, y], at &#8220;Likewise, People who,&#8221; he compares the durability of the two kinds of friendship.
He says that men who are friends by reason of utility break up their friendship when utility ceases,
because they were friends, not of one another, but of the utility they seek. But pleasure comes more from
the beloved in himself, than does utility which sometimes is in an external object.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1591. At &#8220;Therefore, for the sake&#8221; [3, b] he states two differences by which the two kinds of friendship
deviate from perfect friendship. First [b, i] he infers from the discussions that for the sake of pleasure and
utility any type of men can become friends with one another, for example, the good with the good, the
bad with the bad, and even those who are neither virtuous nor vicious with both (i.e., the good and the
bad), and with each other. But only good men make friends in that perfect friendship by which men are
loved for their own sakes; evil men do not provide anything except utility by reason of which they can
love one another or find mutual pleasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1592. He gives the second difference at &#8220;Only the friendship&#8221; [b, ii], saying that only friendship between
virtuous men, which is the perfect kind, is of itself unchangeable. Friendship is destroyed especially when
one friend finds in the other something opposed to their friendship. But this is impossible in friendship
between the virtuous. A man does not readily believe some evil about one whom he has often proved and
never found doing any wrong and in whom he has discovered whatever is considered worthy of true
friendship. Consequently, such a friendship does not break up because it is friendship essentially and not
incidentally, and because it is perfect containing in itself everything requisite for friendship&#8212;the reasons
have been given before (1578-1582); and also because it does not admit as an obstacle to friendship what
is now offered as a reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1593. But in other kinds of friendship nothing hinders one from believing evil of another and acting
unjustly to another. Therefore, some would not be termed friends according to these types of friendship.
But people have usually designated as friends of this kind both those who love for the sake of utility
(friendship is said to exist among states because of the advantage of mutually fighting against their
common enemies) and those who love one another for the sake of pleasure, as is evident among children.
So we should follow the customary way of speaking and call such men friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1594. Last [3, c], at &#8220;There are then,&#8221; he summarizes what has been said about the kinds of friendship,
stating that there are many kinds of friendship. That between good men, as good, being friendship in the
primary and proper sense, while the remaining kinds are called friendship from a likeness to this. Some
men are called friends according to these types of friendship to the extent that there is present a likeness
to true friendship. It is clear that what is pleasurable seems to be a kind of good to those who love
pleasures. So this friendship has a likeness to that which is an unqualified good; and the same argument
prevails in the case of useful friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1595. However, these two kinds of friendship are not so combined that friends for utility and friends for
pleasure are identical, for things that are incidental are not united in all cases, for instance, what is
musical and white.The kinds of friendship just treated are friendships incidentally, as we have pointed
out (1566), hence they are not always combined. If then, according to the division of friendship into the
foregoing species, the evil can be friends among themselves, to that extent they are like one another in
one or other of these aspects. But only the good are friends essentially; others are friends by way of
resemblance, to the extent that they resemble the good.</span></p>

reason is that what is wholly good and pleasurable seems to be lovable and worthy of choice; and a thing
of this nature is lovable and worthy of choice by everyone. But it is for these two reasons that one
virtuous man is good in the eyes of another virtuous man.</span></p>

becomes a good to his friend. So each loves what is good for himself and repays equally both in goodwill
and in pleasantness. The reason is that friendship is a kind of equality. What has been said applies
especially to the friendship which exists between virtuous men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1596. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of friendship, he now [II] treats them in relation
to the proper act of friendship. On this point he does two things. First [II, A] he distinguishes friendship
by reason of habit and act. Second [II, B], at &#8220;Affection resembles etc.,&#8221; he proves what he had assumed.
He discusses the first point from three aspects. First [A, 1] he distinguishes the kinds of friendship by
way of habit and act. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;However, if etc.,&#8221; he shows that some lose friendship by lack of
friendly acts. Last [A, 3], at &#8220;Friendship then etc.,&#8221; he shows that friendship especially between virtuous
men arises from the nature of the very act of friendship. He says first that, as in other virtues some men
are called good or virtuous by reason of habit (for example, the brave or the generous) even when they
are not performing the act of virtue, but others are called virtuous for actually performing a virtuous
action; so too in friendship some are friends actually inasmuch as they live together pleasantly and do
good for one another&#8212;two things that seem to belong to the act of friendship. But others are not actually
performing the works of friendship, although they are so disposed by habit that they are inclined to
perform such works&#8212;this is obvious of friends who are asleep or locally separated from one another.
Indeed, separation does not sever friendship itself but only friendship&#8217;s activity. Thus it is evident that
the habit of friendship remains even when its expression ceases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1597. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;However, if the absence,&#8221; he shows how in some cases friendship ceases from a
lack of friendly acts. First [2, a] he explains his proposition. Second [2, b], at &#8220;Nothing is so etc.,&#8221; he
proves what he had assumed. He explains his proposition in regard to three classes of men. First [a, i],
about those who are separated from one another for a long time. He says that if the absence of friends
from one another is prolonged, it seems to cause forgetfulness of a previous friendship. In this way other
habits are also weakened and finally disappear from lack of use. As habits are acquired by practice, they
must be preserved by practice, for everything is preserved by its cause. For that reason it has become
proverbial that many friendships are destroyed through a man&#8217;s neglect to call upon his friend, to
converse and associate with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1598. Second [a, ii], at &#8220;Neither old men,&#8221; he shows the same thing about the old and the morose. He
says that neither the old nor the morose, i.e., people severe in word and social intercourse, seem to be
friendly or disposed for friendship because they are not inclined to the activity of friendship, namely,
association. Very little that is pleasant is found in them. For this reason they are not easy to live with, for
no one can spend his days (i.e., a long time) with a man who is gloomy or with one who is unpleasant.
Men and other animals find it natural to avoid pain and seek pleasure which appears to be simply repose
of the appetite in a desired good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1599. Third [a, iii], at &#8220;But those who,&#8221; he shows the same thing about a third class of men, viz., those
who are acceptable to one another in this, that one approves the ways and conduct of the other although
for some reason the two never live together. Such persons, he says, are more like well-wishers than
friends because friendship requires living together for some time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1600. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Nothing is so, &#8220; he proves what he had assumed, namely, that living together is
required for friendship as its proper act. He says nothing is so characteristic of friends as living together.
Previously (1595) he stated that two works belong to the act of friendship: living together and bestowing
favors on one another&#8212;this is to bring a friend some benefit, a thing that not all but only the needy seek
from friends. Even happy people, i.e., those with abundance (who do not like to be alone) desire to spend
their days (i.e., a long time) with friends. Nor can men associate with one another if they are not mutually
pleasant and do not rejoice in the same things&#8212;two qualities found in the friendship of those who are
brought up together. So then it is evident that the principal act of friendship is to live with one&#8217;s friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1601. At &#8220;Friendship then&#8221; [A, 3] he concludes from the premises that friendship between virtuous., men
is friendship in the best sense, as we have frequently noted (1574-1579, 1592). That seems to be lovable
and absolutely worthy of choice in itself which is wholly good and pleasurable. But something of this
nature, i.e., good or pleasurable in itself is lovable and worthy of choice for everyone. But one virtuous
man is lovable to another and worthy of choice for these two reasons: each is good and pleasant without
qualification, and each is good and pleasant to the other. Consequently, virtuous men especially can live
pleasantly with one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1602. Then [II, B], at &#8220;Affection resembles,&#8221; he proves what he had previously assumed: that friendship
may be predicated not only according to act but also according to habit. On this point he does three
things. First [B, 1] he states his proposal, saying that affection seems to indicate passion. But friendship
seems to indicate habit and to be like other habits.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1603. Second [B, 2], at &#8220;Affection, however,&#8221; he proves his proposition by two reasons. The first [2, a]
is that one-sided love can be bestowed even on lifeless objects, as we are said to love wine or gold. But
mutual love&#8212;which belongs to the notion of friendship, as we have indicated (1557)&#8212;is accompanied
by deliberate choice, for this is found only among rational beings. But what is done by choice is not done
from passion but rather from habit. Therefore friendship is a habit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1604. He gives the second reason at &#8220;Men wish&#8221; [2, b], saying that by friendship men wish good to
friends for their friends&#8217; sake. If men wished good for their own sake they would love themselves rather
than others. But to love others for their sake is not from passion because passion, since it belongs to the
sensitive&#8217; appetite, does not go beyond the particular good of the one loving. Consequently, it remains
that this is from habit; and so friendship is a habit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1605. Third [B, 3], at &#8220;Likewise, those who love,&#8221; he answers an implied objection. It has just been said
(1601) that what is good to anyone is lovable to him. It seems contrary to this, that a man loves his friend
for the friend&#8217;s sake. But he answers that those who love a friend love what is good to themselves. When
a person, who is a good in himself &#8216; becomes a friend to someone, he also becomes a good to his friend.
So each, in loving his friend, loves what is good for himself; and each makes an equal return to his friend
both in the fact of willing &#8212;as he wishes good to his friend&#8212;and in the kind of willing. He wishes good
to his friend not for his own but for the friend&#8217;s sake. The reason is that friendship is a kind of equality
precisely as it requires mutual love. This seems to be an addition above the mode of virtue, for in any
virtue the act of the virtuous man is enough. But in friendship the act of one is not sufficient but the acts
of two mutually loving one another must concur. For that reason the Philosopher did not state absolutely
that it is a virtue but added &#8220;or at least accompanies virtue,&#8221; because it seems to add something above
the notion of virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1606. The observations that have been made about friendship seem to be especially applicable to
friendship between virtuous men.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But friendship among morose and elderly people occurs less frequently inasmuch as they are more
peevish and have little taste for conversations that especially seem to be the marks and cause of
friendship. For this reason youths make friends quickly but not old people, for they cannot become
friends of those whose company they do not enjoy. The same reason holds for austere persons who,
nevertheless, entertain kindly feelings toward one another; for they wish each other well and assist one
another in their needs. However, they do not really become friends because they do not live together nor
take pleasure in one another&#8217;s company-activities that are especially characteristic of friendship.</span></p>

such people (who excel the good man in virtue) are not easy to find.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">We have explained that these are less perfect and also less enduring friendships. Indeed according to their
similarity or dissimilarity to the same thing they seem to be or not to be friendships. Inasmuch as they
have a likeness to friendship based on virtue they seem to be friendships; for one kind has pleasure and
the other utility. But perfect friendship has both. They differ, however, for perfect friendship is
unchanging and permanent while the others quickly change; on account of this dissimilarity the latter do
not seem to be genuine friendships.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1607. After the Philosopher has distinguished the different kinds of friendship, he now [III] discusses
these friendships in relation to their subject, that is, to friends themselves. This aspect he treats from three
angles. First [III, A] he treats the aptitude and ineptitude of some persons for friendship; then [III, B], at
&#8220;It is not possible etc.,&#8221; the number of friends; last [III, C], at &#8220;Men in power etc.,&#8221; the differentiation
of friends. He says first that the more peevish they are, the fewer friendships morose and elderly people
form because, presuming on themselves, they follow their own way, For that reason they cannot agree
with others: they have little taste for conversation with others both because they are intent on themselves
and because they are suspicious of others. But concord and conversation with friends seem especially
to be the works of friendship and its cause.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1608. Consequently youths, who find much pleasure in conversation and readily agree with others,
quickly make friends. This does not happen with old people, for they cannot become friends of those
whose company and conversation they do not enjoy. The same reason holds for morose persons who are
quarrelsome and critical of what others do. But such people, i.e., the elderly and the severe, can be
benevolent inasmuch as they affectively wish good to others and even effectively assist them in their
needs. However they do not really become friends because they do not live with nor take pleasure in the
company of their friends-activities that seem to be the special works of friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1609. Then [III, B], at &#8220;It is not possible,&#8221; he treats the number of friends. He explains this point in a
threefold manner. First [ B, 1 ] he shows that it is not possible to be a friend to many people by the
perfect friendship that exists between virtuous persons. Second [B, 2], at &#8220;In friendships etc.,&#8221; he shows
that this happens in two other kinds of friendship: those for utility and pleasure. Third [B, 3], at
&#8220;Friendship between etc.,&#8221; he compares the two kinds of friends with one another. He shows first, by
three reasons, that it is not possible for a person to be a friend of many people by perfect friendship built
on the good of virtue. The first [1, a] is that, since this friendship is perfect and best, it has a likeness to
excess in loving-if the extent of love be considered. But if we consider the notion of loving there cannot
be an excess. It is not possible for virtue and a virtuous person to be loved excessively by another
virtuous person who regulates his affections by reason. Superabundant love is not designed by nature for
many but for one only. This is evident in sexual love according to which one man cannot at the same time
love many women in an excessive manner. Therefore, the perfect friendship of the virtuous cannot extend
to many persons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1610. He gives the second reason [I, b] at &#8220;Then too it is difficult.&#8221; It is this. In perfect friendship friends
are exceedingly pleasing to one another. But it is not easy for many to be exceedingly pleasing at the
same time to the same individual, because few are to be found who do not have something displeasing
to a person affected in some way by man&#8217;s many defects and conflicting dispositions. Thus it happens
that, while one is very pleasing, another may not be. Perhaps it is fortunate and desirable that many
cannot be exceedingly pleasing to one man who, while associating with many, would not be able to care
for himself. Therefore, one cannot be a friend to many by perfect friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1611. He gives the third reason [i, c] at &#8220;Besides, friendship etc.&#8221; It is this. In perfect friendship we must
become acquainted with a friend by habitual association. But this is very hard and cannot happen with
many people. Therefore, one does not have many friends by perfect friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1612. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;In friendships,&#8221; he shows that in the other two kinds of friendship, which are based
on utility and pleasure, it is possible for a man to have many friends who are pleasing to him; and this
for two reasons. First, because many can be useful and pleasant. Second, because a long period of trial
is not required, it suffices that for a short time people provide one another with pleasure, for example,
or even some utility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1613. Then [B, 3], at &#8220;Friendship between such,&#8221; he compares the two kinds of friends. First [3, a] he
states his proposition: with those just mentioned, among whom one can have many friends, friendship
for pleasure&#8217;s sake seems to be more like true friendship; on condition, though that the same thing is done
by both, namely, each affords pleasure to the other, for in this way they rejoice in the same things&#8212;a
characteristic of friendship. In fact, this is an indication that there is one pleasure for those who delight
in the same things. But the case is different when pleasure is occasioned on the part of one and utility on
the part of the other. However, such are the friendships among youths that on either side they love each
other for the sake of pleasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1614. Second [3, b], at &#8220;Their friendship,&#8221; he proves his proposition by two reasons. The first [b, il] is
that in pleasurable friendship friends love one another more generously than in useful friendship in which
a profitable return is sought&#8212;this friendship seems to be a kind of business affair. Hence friendship for
the sake of pleasure is more powerful, as more resembling perfect friendship, which is most generous
inasmuch as by it friends are loved for their own sakes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1615. He gives the second reason [b, ii] at &#8220;But fortunate people.&#8221; It is this. Fortunate men, i.e., the rich,
have no need of useful friends since they are sufficient unto themselves, but they do have need of
pleasant friends, for they must live with others; and this is impossible without pleasantness. People can
bear unpleasantness for a time. But no man can continuously endure something unpleasant; he could not
even stand good itself if it were displeasing. Consequently men who do not find pleasure in virtuous
activities cannot persevere in them, So then it is evident that pleasurable friendship is more effectual than
useful friendship, as being necessary to a great number and to more generous people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">T616. Third [3, c], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he infers a corollary from the discussions. Since even an
honorable good would be intolerable if it were distasteful, it follows that friends for virtue&#8217;s sake must
be pleasant to one another. They must be not only good in themselves, but also good to one another. Thus
they will have the requisites for friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1617. Next [III, C], at &#8220;Men in power,&#8221; he treats the distinction of friends. On this point he does three
things. First [C, 1] he states his proposition, that men situated in positions of power are accustomed to
different kinds of friends in such a way that some are useful to them and others pleasant. It is not usual
for the same men to be their friends in both ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1618. Second [C, 2], at &#8220;Nor do the powerful,&#8221; he proves his proposition from the fact that these
powerful men do not seek the pleasures of virtue&#8212;this type of pleasure has utility connected with it. Nor
do they seek friends useful in the attainment of honorable good&#8212;this utility has a pleasure attached to
it. For amusement they seek witty or entertaining people, like comedians. But for utility they desire other
friends (<i>dinos</i>) i.e., shrewd in executing whatever is commanded, either good or bad. These two qualities,
viz., shrewdness and jocularity, are not found in the same person because skillful people are not given
to jesting but to serious matters. Hence it is evident that the powerful have different kinds of friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1619. Third [C, 3], at &#8220;It has been said, though,&#8221; he answers an objection. Someone can object that
friends of the powerful are at the same time pleasant and useful because, as was explained previously
(1585), a good or virtuous person is at the same time pleasant and useful. But Aristotle answers that the
virtuous man does not become a friend of one eminent in power or riches unless the virtuous person is
surpassed in virtue by the powerful. If this is not the case, the more powerful one who is surpassed in
virtue does not make himself proportionately equal, i.e., does not give proportionate compensation to the
virtuous man; that is to say, as the virtuous person defers to him as the more powerful so he should defer
to the virtuous man as the better.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1620. Usually, to the extent that men excel in power and riches they think themselves better; and we are
not accustomed to find men in power who also excel in virtue or defer to the virtuous as the better.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1621. Then [III, D], at &#8220;Consequently, the friendships,&#8221; he shows that the kinds of friendship discussed
consist in equality. He treats this point in a twofold manner. First [D, 1] he explains his proposition,
concluding from the premises that the kinds of friendship just treated consist in equality. Since this is
obvious about friendship for the sake of virtue, he proves the proposition in regard to friendship based
on utility and pleasure: either men wish and do the same things for one another, i.e., return pleasure for
pleasure or utility for utility, or they exchange one for the other, i.e., utility for pleasure or vice versa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1622. Next [D, 2], at &#8220;We have explained,&#8221; he shows how the two kinds compare with the definition of
friendship. He says that from the discussions obviously the kinds of friendship which are less proper are
less lasting than the perfect friendship of the virtuous, according to whose likeness or unlikeness
friendships seem to be or not to be denominated. Inasmuch as they resemble perfect friendship they seem
to be friendship according as one of them has pleasure and another utility. Perfect friendship has both.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1623. But in respect to other qualities they are dissimilar according as perfect friendship is unchanging
and lasting. The remaining kinds, however, quickly change; they also differ in many other particulars,
as is evident from the previous discussions (1594-1595). On account of this dissimilarity they do not
seem to be species of true friendship.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1624. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of friendship that consist in equality, he now
distinguishes the kinds of friendship that exist between unequal persons. He treats two aspects of this
subject. First he determines the things pertaining in general to the distinction of such friendships. Then
[Lect. 9], at &#8220;As we noted at the outset etc.&#8221; (B. 1159 b 25), he treats the distinction of these friendships
according to their particular natures. On the first point he does two things. First [I] he discusses the
friendships of a superior for a subordinate, as father for son, husband for wife. Second [Lect. 8; II], at
&#8220;Between opposites, however etc.&#8221; (B. 1159 b 12), he discusses friendships existing between opposites,
like a poor man and a rich man, and so on. He treats the first point in a threefold manner. First [I, A] he
distinguishes the classification of this friendship from the previous kinds of friendships. Then [I, B], at
&#8220;These friendships, though etc.,&#8221; he distinguishes friendships of this type from one another. Last [I, C],
at &#8220;Certainly the same benefits etc.,&#8221; he shows how these friendships are preserved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1625. He says first that besides the foregoing friendships, which we said (1562-1595) consist in equality
from the fact that they belong to persons having likeness in virtue or utility or pleasure, there is another
kind of friendship that consists in inequality (inasmuch as one person excels another), as the friendship
of a father with a son, or&#8212;in general&#8212;of an older with a younger person, or of a husband with a wife,
or for the most part of a superior with a subordinate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1626. Then [I, B], at &#8220;These friendships, though,&#8221; he differentiates these friendships from one another.
First [B, 1] he states his proposal, saying that friendships of this type differ in kind. He assigns two
differences, one according to various relations of inequality: the friendship of a father for a son is one
kind, and of a ruler for his subject is another. Another difference is according to the contrasting relation
of the superior and subordinate; for the friendship of a father for a son is not the same as the friendship
of a son for a father, nor is the friendship of a husband for a wife the same as the friendship of a wife for
a husband.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1627, Second [B, 2], at &#8220;Indeed the virtue,&#8221; he explains his proposal by two reasons. The first [2, a] is
that, since friendship may be predicated according to habit and act, every friend necessarily should have
an habitual disposition to do the things pertaining to friendship as well as the function itself of friendship.
But it is clear in the case of the persons just mentioned that the function is not the same, for example of
a father toward a son and of a husband toward a wife or even of a son toward a father; and consequently
there is not the same virtue. Therefore, they are also different kinds of friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1628. He gives the second reason [2, b] at &#8220;Different, too, are.&#8221; It is this. In these friendships there are
different motives why people love. It is for a different reason that a father loves a son and a son loves a
father, and a husband loves a wife. But according to the different reasons for loving there are different
kinds of love and so different kinds of friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1629. Next [I, C], at &#8220;Certainly the same benefits,&#8221; he shows how these friendships are preserved. First
[C, 1] he explains that they are preserved by the parties mutually offering what. they should in regard to
loving and being loved. Then [Lect. 8; C, 2], at &#8220;Because of a desire for honor etc.&#8221; (B. 1159 a 13), he
explains how loving and being loved are related to friendship. He discusses the first point in a threefold
manner. First [1, a] he shows how these friendships are preserved because the parties mutually offer what
is proper. Next [1, b], at &#8220;In all friendships etc.,&#8221; he shows that these reciprocations are considered
according to proportionality. Last [1, c], at &#8220;Equality, however etc.,&#8221; he explains how this applies to
justice and friendship in a different manner. He says first that in these friendships the same benefits are
not bestowed by each friend, and it is unnecessary to expect in return the same benefits that one bestows.
For example, a son ought not to ask of his father the reverence that the son shows the father, as in the
previous friendships pleasure was offered for pleasure and utility for utility. But when children show
their parents what is due those who have generated them, and when parents show their children what is
due their offspring, there will exist between them a lasting and just or virtuous friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">163o. Next [I, b], at &#8220;In all friendships,&#8221; he shows how what is proper is offered in these friendships. He
says that in all friendships involving inequality of one person to the other, love is given proportionately,
so that the superior party is loved more than he loves; the same is true concerning the person who is more
useful, more pleasant, or more excellent in any way whatsoever. For when each person is loved by reason
of the worth he manifests, an equality of proportion that apparently pertains to friendship will ensue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1631. Then [1, c], at &#8220;Equality, however,&#8221; he shows how this is applicable to justice and friendship in
a different manner. First [c, i] he gives the difference. Second [c, ii], at &#8220;This is clearly etc.,&#8221; he makes
it clear by an indication. Last [c, iii], at &#8220;From this a doubt etc., he solves a doubt. He says first that
equality and proportion, which are considered in the light of one&#8217;s excellence, are not found in the same
way in justice and friendship. For, as we have noted in the fifth book (935) concerning justice, excellence
first must be accounted or judged according to proportion, and then an exchange will be made according
to equality. But in friendship, on the contrary, an equality between the persons loving one another first
must be taken into consideration and then what is in conformity with excellence must be offered to each.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1632. The reason for this difference is that friendship is a kind of union or association of friends that
cannot exist between widely separated persons; but they must approach equality. Hence it pertains to
friendship to use an equality already uniformly established, but it pertains to justice to reduce unequal
things to an equality. When equality exists the work of justice is done. For that reason equality is the goal
of justice and the starting point of friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1633. At &#8220;This is clearly&#8221; [c, ii] he clarifies his statement by an indication. He discusses this point in a
threefold way. First [ii, x] he states the indication . He says that the declaration (1631 1632) of the prime
necessity of equality in friendship is obvious from the fact that, if there is a great difference in virtue or
vice or any other thing, men do not remain friends; nor is it considered suitable for people to maintain
friendship with those who differ considerably from themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1634. Second [ii, y], at &#8220;This is evident,&#8221; he gives three examples. First, of beings who greatly surpass
men in all good things. Hence they do not maintain friendship with men so as to converse and live with
them. These separated substances Aristotle calls gods, according to pagan custom. The second example
is of kings whose friendship people in humbler walks of life are not likely to have. He takes the third
example from the best and wisest of men, with whom individuals of little worth do not become friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1635. Third [ii, z], at &#8220;In such matters,&#8221; he answers an implied question. Someone might ask what
barriers can friendship overcome and what barriers can it not overcome. Aristotle answers that in such
matters an exact determination is not possible. But it suffices to know in general that many qualities can
be absent from one that are present in the other and the friendship still remains. If the persons are far
apart, like men from God, then the friendship we are discussing does not survive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1636, Then [c, iii], at &#8220;From this a doubt,&#8221; he solves an incidental doubt. First [iii, x] he raises it. He says
that from the discussions a doubt arises whether men can wish their friends the greatest goods, for
example, that they be gods or kings or most virtuous. It seems not, because then they will no longer have
their friends, and in this way they themselves will lose great benefits, viz., their friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1637. Next [iii, y], at &#8220;If it was,&#8221; he solves this doubt in two ways. First [y, aa], when it was explained
before (1604) that a man wishes good things to a friend for his sake, we must suppose that the friend
himself remains much the same, whatever that may be, after the possession of these goods. A person
wishes the most excellent goods to a friend as he is a man, not as he is changed into a god.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1638. He gives the second solution at &#8220;but perhaps.&#8221; He asserts that a man wishes good to his friend, but
not more than to all others, because everyone wishes good to himself most of all. Hence it is not
reasonable that a man should wish a friend those goods by which he will lose that friend who is a great
good.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">And yet men do not seem to desire honor for its own sake but only incidentally. The common run of men
delight to be honored by the powerful because they hope to obtain something they need; they rejoice in

desiring to confirm their own opinion about themselves. They delight, therefore, in a sense of their own
goodness, having confidence in the judgment so expressed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Friendship, however, seems to consist rather in loving than in being loved. An indication of this is that
mothers take more pleasure in loving than in being loved by their offspring. Some mothers give to others
the rearing of their children; and while knowing them to be their children they love them, but do not seek
a return of love if it is impossible both to love and be loved. They seem satisfied to know that their little
ones are doing well; they love them even if the children in their ignorance cannot offer what is due a
mother.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Since friendship consists rather in loving and friends are praised for it, the excellence of a friend seems
to be found in loving. For this reason persons who love their friends in proportion to their worth remain
friends and their friendship is lasting. In this way, more than any other, those who are unequal will
become friends because they will thus be made equal. But then friendship is a kind of equality and
likeness.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1639. After the Philosopher has determined that friendship between unequal persons is maintained by
a proportionality of loving and being loved, he now [C, 2] shows how loving and being loved pertain to
friendship. On this point he does two things. First [2, a] he shows that loving is more characteristic of
friendship than being loved. Then [2, b], at &#8220;Since friendship etc.,&#8221; he shows that friendship is preserved
by loving according to excellence or proportionately. He treats the first point from three aspects. First
[a, i] he shows why some people wish rather to be loved than to love. Second [a, ii], at &#8220;And yet men
etc.,&#8221; he compares being loved with being honored. Third [a, iii], at &#8220;Friendship, however etc.,&#8221; he shows
that loving is more proper to friendship than being loved. He discusses the first point in a threefold
manner. First [i, x] he states his proposition saying that the majority seem to wish rather to be loved than
to love; and this because they are lovers of honor. It befits the more worthy, to whom honor is due, rather
to be loved than to love.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1640. Next [i, y], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he confirms his statement. From the fact that many people wish
to be loved rather than to love, it follows that they are fond of flattery; they take pleasure in someone
fawning upon them. The flatterer is either really a friend of humbler status, since it is characteristic of
the lowly to indulge in flattery; or by flattering pretends to be a friend and to love more than he is loved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1641. Third [i, z], at &#8220;Being loved,&#8221; he explains his statement (1639) that it is because of honor that men
wish rather to be loved than to love. He states that being loved seems to be closely connected with being
honored which many desire. Honor indeed is a mark of goodness in him who is honored; and anything
that is good or apparently good is loved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1642. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;And yet men&#8221; he compares being loved with being honored. On this point he does
three things. First [a, ii, x] he shows why people wish to be honored, saying that men apparently desire
honor not for itself but incidentally. They seek to be honored especially by men of two classes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1643. Many are glad to be honored by the powerful, not for the honor itself but by reason of the hope
they derive from it. They expect to obtain something they need from those who honor them. So they
delight in the honor as a mark of the good disposition or kindly affection of the persons honoring them.
But there are others who want to be honored by just men, that is, by the virtuous and wise because in this
way they seek to confirm a personal opinion about their own goodness. Thus they really rejoice in the
fact that they are virtuous, as it were, accepting this for the judgment of good men who by the very act
of honoring them seem to say they are good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1644. Second [a, ii, y], at &#8220;People however,&#8221; he teaches that men delight in the fact itself of being loved,
since the very possession of friends seems to be the principal external sign of honor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1645. Third [a, ii, z], at &#8220;Therefore, being loved,&#8221; he draws a conclusion. Since what is essential is more
excellent than what is incidental, it follows from the premises (1642-1644) that being loved is better than
being honored inasmuch as friendship is in itself desirable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1646. At &#8220;Friendship, however&#8221; [a, iii] he shows in what the excellence of friendship consists: in loving
or being loved. He says it consists rather in loving, for friendship is predicated by way of habit, as has
been explained (1596, 1602, 1627). But a habit terminates at activity; and loving is certainly an activity,
while being loved is rather passivity. Hence loving is more proper to friendship than being loved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1647. He makes this clear by an example. Mothers who have a strong affection for their children take
more pleasure in loving them than in being loved by them. Some mothers give their children to others
to rear; knowing the children to be theirs they love them, nevertheless they do not strive much for a return
of love, since this is not possible. But it seems enough for the mothers to see that their children do well
and are in good health. Thus they love their little ones although the little ones cannot make a suitable
return of love because of ignorance, since the children do not know them to be their mothers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1648. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Since friendship,&#8221; he shows how friendship is maintained by loving according to
excellence or proportionately. First [b, i] he shows how friendship is lasting because of the proportion
that love achieves. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;This likeness is found etc.,&#8221; he compares the different kinds of
friendship relative to what has been said before. He says first that, since friendship consists rather in
loving than in being loved, friends are praised because they love and not because they are loved; in fact
this is the compliment we pay lovers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1649. Because everyone is praised for his own virtue, the virtue of a lover should be judged according
to his love. For this reason persons who love their friends in proportion to their worth remain friends and
their friendship is lasting. Thus, when people love one another according to their worth, even those who
are of unequal condition can be friends because they are made equal in this way&#8212;provided that the one
who is more lacking in goodness or some other excellence loves that much more. In this way the
abundance of love makes up for the inadequacy of condition. So by a kind of equality and likeness, which
properly belong to friendship, people become and remain friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1650. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;This likeness,&#8221; he compares the different kinds of friendship in reference to his
previous statements. First [b, ii, x] he shows which friendship is most enduring. He says that the likeness,
which causes and preserves friendship, seems to be found especially among virtuous men; for they
remain like-minded both in themselves&#8212;they do not easily change from one thing to another&#8212;and in
friendship with one another. This is so because the one has no need for the other to do anything evil for
him, which would be contrary to the virtue of the agent. In this way neither of them serves the other in
any evil. But if any evil may possibly occur among the virtuous, one rather prevents the other from doing
wrong; for it is characteristic of virtuous men that they neither sin themselves nor allow their friends to
commit sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1651. Second [b, ii, y], at &#8220;Evil men, however,&#8221; he shows which friendship is least enduring, stating that
evil men do not have any steadfastness or stability about them. The reason is that wickedness, to which
they adhere, is in itself hateful and so their affection varies when they find nothing in which the will can
repose; in this way they do not&#8217;long remain like-minded. But they desire things contrary to what they
previously wanted. Thus they are friends for a short time, as long as they enjoy the evil in which they
agree.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1652. Third [b, ii, z], at &#8220;But friends for utility&#8221; he shows which friendships hold a middle place in this
matter. He says that friends for utility and pleasure remain longer together in friendship than do friends
in evil. Utility and pleasure are such that they may be loved. Hence friendships of this kind last as long
as pleasure and utility are mutually provided. But it is otherwise with those who are friends for the sake
of evil which has no lovableness in itself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1653. Next [II], at &#8220;Between opposites, however,&#8221; he discusses friendship between persons of disparate
condition. First [II, A] he shows under what species of friendship we may place friendship between
opposites. Then [II, B], at &#8220;Perhaps one opposite etc.,&#8221; he explains how contrary may seek contrary. On
the first point he does three things. First [A, 1] he shows that this friendship between persons of disparate
condition seems to be for the sake of utility, inasmuch as one friend seeks from the other what he himself
needs, and gives something in return to the other. Thus a poor man desires to obtain money from the rich
man in return for service.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1654. Next [A, 2], at &#8220;To this type&#8221; he shows how this may be characteristic also of pleasurable
friendship. He states that to this type of friendship we may reduce sexual love by which the lover loves
the beloved; for sometimes there is the disparity of beauty and ugliness. On the other hand, in friendship
based on virtue, there is no disparate condition because the greatest likeness is found in it, as was noted
previously (1580).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1655. Third [A, 3], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he infers a corollary from the discussion. He says that since
sometimes a contrary condition exists in the lover and the beloved, for example, ugliness and beauty, it
follows that sometimes lovers are derided who think they are worthy of being loved as much as they love.
This is fitting when they are equally worthy of love. But if they have nothing of such a nature that they
are worthy to be so loved it is ridiculous for them to ask it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1656. At&#8217;Terhaps one opposite&#8221; [II, B] he shows how contrary seeks its contrary. He says that this is not
true from the nature of the thing (<i>secundum se</i>) but incidentally, for what is essentially (<i>per se</i>) sought
is the mean which is the good of the subject induced to excess by one of contraries. For example, if a
man&#8217;s body is comfortably dry, perspiration is not good and desirable absolutely (<i>per se</i>) speaking, but
as a means to a middle state attained by the moisture. The same reason holds for what is hot and
contraries of this kind. Because these matters belong more to the study of physics, he says they will be
passed over.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Brothers and comrades have all things in common. But other associates have certain definite things in
common; some have more in common, others less. In accordance with this some friendships likewise
differ in degree.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Similarly the notions of justice differ. The same kind of right does not exist between parents and children
as between brother and brother; nor are relations between companions the same as between fellow
citizens. This is likewise the case in other types of friendship. Therefore, different acts of injustice are
found among the persons just mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.731667in; margin-left: 0.731667in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He shows how justice is differentiated according to... friendship. &#8212; 1663-1664</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Moreover, acts of injustice are aggravated by being done to close friends. For example, it is more
shameful to steal money from a comrade than a fellow citizen; to refuse help to a brother than a stranger;
to strike one&#8217;s father than someone else. Friendship and justice naturally increase at the same time as they
exist between the same persons and are equally extensive.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">All associations are like parts of civic association, for men come together for some advantage and acquire
something necessary for life. But civic association seems to be formed and to endure for the sake of
advantage, so that the citizens might seek and obtain some benefit accruing. Indeed legislators aim at this,
and men call that just which contributes to the common good.</span></p>

1668</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Still other associations seem to be formed for the sake of pleasure, for example, religious choirs or

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But all these were usually placed under civic association that aims not at present gain but at what is
profitable all during life. And the people offer sacrifice and arrange gatherings to render honor to the
gods and to acquire rest and pleasure for themselves. For the ancient sacrifices and gatherings took place
after the harvest as an offering of first fruits, for at this period men had most leisure.</span></p>

friendships that we discussed will correspond to these associations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1657. After the Philosopher has treated the different kinds of friendships existing between unequal
persons, he now distinguishes them according to their proper formalities. He handles this in two ways.
First he shows that these kinds of friendships are distinguished in much the same way as civic
associations. Then [Lect. 10; I], at &#8220;There are three kinds etc.&#8221; (B.1160 a 30), he distinguishes the kinds
of friendships according to the distinctions of civic units. Concerning the first point he gives this
argument. [A] Every friendship consists in association. [B] Every association is reduced to civic
association. Therefore all friendships must be understood according to civic associations
(<i>communicationes</i>). He treats this argument under three aspects. First he proves the first statement [A];
second, at &#8220;All associations are etc..&#8221; he proves the second statement [B]; third, at &#8220;all these associations
etc.,&#8221; he draws a conclusion [C]. He does two things in regard to the first point. First [A, 1] he shows that
every friendship consists in association. Next [A, 2], at &#8220;Brothers and comrades etc.,&#8221; he shows that
friendship is differentiated according to the diversity of association.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1658. First [1, a], by the following argument. As was previously explained (1632) justice and friendship
deal with the same things. But justice consists in association&#8217; for every kind of justice has a relation to
another, as we stated in the fifth book (885, 886, 906, 909, 934). Therefore friendship too consists in
association.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1659. Second [I, b], at &#8220;Consequently, fellow voyagers,&#8221; he shows the same thing by customary speech.
Men are accustomed to call friends those who share in any common undertaking: for example, fellow
voyagers who take part in seafaring; fellow soldiers who share in military service. The same is true in
other kinds of association, because friendship seems to exist among people to the extent that they share
with one another; and because, in accordance with this, justice also exists among them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1660. Third [i, c], at &#8220;Correctly then&#8221; he proves his contention by a current proverb. it is generally said
that friends&#8217; goods are common goods. Therefore friendship consists in sharing in common
(<i>communicatio</i>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1661. At &#8220;Brothers and comrades&#8221; [A, 2] he shows that friendships differ according to different modes
of association. He discusses this point under three aspects. First [2, a] he explains the diversity of
friendships according to the diversity of association. We see that brothers and similar relatives have all
things in common, like home, table, and so on. But other friends have particular things as their own; some
have more, some less. In accordance with this some friendships are greater, for example, among those
who have many things in common; and others are less, as among those who have few things in common.
From this it is very evident that if there were no communication there could be no friendship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1662. Second [2, b], at &#8220;Similarly the notions,&#8221; he shows that justice is differentiated according to
different types of association. The same kind of right is not found in every association, but a different
kind. Thus it is obvious that the same right does not exist between father and sons, as between brother
and brother. Likewise there is a different justice between <i>etairos</i>, i.e., people of the same age and rearing
than between citizens, because they bestow different things on one another as mutually due. The same
pattern holds in other kinds of friendship. So it is clear that different types of justice exist between the
individuals just mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1663. Third [3, b], at &#8220;Moreover, acts of injustice,&#8221; he shows how justice is differentiated according to
the diversity of friendship. He says justice and injustice increase in proportion as they are done to closer
friends. The reason is that it is just in a greater degree to do good to a closer friend, and unjust in a
greater degree to injure him. So it is more offensive and unjust to rob or steal money from a familiar
acquaintance or a comrade than from a fellow citizen; likewise, to withhold help from a brother than a
stranger; to strike one&#8217;s father than to strike someone else.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1664. That justice and friendship are extended at the same time arises from this, that they exist in the
same persons and both pertain equally to some communication. This is confirmation of what was stated
previously (1661).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1665. Then [B], at &#8220;All associations&#8221; he shows that all associations are reduced to civic association. He
treats this point in a twofold manner. First [B, 1] he shows that all association has a likeness to civic
association. Second [B, 2], at &#8220;Other associations then etc.,&#8221; he shows that all other associations are
contained under civic association. He says first that every association has some likeness to the parts of
civic association. We see that all associations agree in something useful, in the fact that they acquire
something necessary for living. And civic association also appears to have this because fellow citizens
seem both to have come together in the beginning and to have remained together for their common
interest. This is evident for two reasons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1666. First, because legislators seem to aim at this most of all, to obtain the general welfare. Second,
because men call that just in a state which benefits the citizens generally.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1667. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;Other associations,&#8221; he shows that other associations are contained under civic
association. On this point he does three things. First [2, a] he shows how some of the other associations
are directed to a particular interest. He says that associations other than the civic intend some private
gain. For example, fellow voyagers intend to acquire money or something of the sort if they are
merchants. If they are soldiers they agree in the objective of the war, whether this be riches, victory
alone, or capture of a city. In this way, too, those who belong to one tribe or one people agree on some
private gain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1668. Second [2, b], at &#8220;Still other associations,&#8221; he shows that even associations that are apparently
formed for pleasure are really for some utility. He says still other associations seemingly exist for
pleasure, e.g., choruses or those who sing together in a choir or a dance, and bands or those who play
brass instruments like trumpets and cymbals. Associations of this kind were accustomed to be established
for the sake of the religious cult so that men may be more pleasantly detained there, and on account of
a wedding or nuptials that the groom and bride may have greater pleasure since they share in such great
rejoicing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1669. Third [2, c], at &#8220;But all these,&#8221; he shows from the premises that all the other previous associations
are contained under civic association. He says that all were usually placed under civic association
inasmuch as customarily all are directed by it. He gives the explanation because, as previously observed
(1667), other associations are ordered to some private advantage. Civic association, however, does not
aim at a private and present gain but at what is useful all during life. He shows this especially in regard
to associations of persons providing entertainment; and most of all in sacrifices where it seems less
evident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1670. Aristotle says that people who offer sacrifice in gatherings of this kind intend to render honor to
God and to acquire for themselves repose and a little pleasure, which is ordered to the good of living.
Wherefore the ancients, also, gathered together after the harvest in the autumn to offer sacrifices, that
is, to pay first-fruits. This was a suitable time for men to have leisure both that they might rest from their
recent labors and because abundant food was available. So obviously all these things are subjected to the
ordering of the state as they pertain to the benefit of living.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1671. At &#8220;All these associations&#8221; [C] he leads up to the conclusion intended, viz., that all associations
are contained under civic association, as parts of it; to this extent others are directed to particular interests
but civic association to the common welfare. Now since friendships are formed in relation to associations
of this kind, it follows that the distinction of friendships should be observed according to the distinction
of civic association.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The perversion of kingdom is called tyranny. Both are forms of monarchy but they differ very much, for
a tyrant aims at his own selfish interest while a king strives for the good of his subjects. No man is truly
a king who is not adequate of himself to rule and does not abound in all good things. Such a one is in
need of nothing and therefore will not work for himself but for his subjects. Then too a king not
independent of his subjects will resemble a ruler chosen by lot. But the very opposite of a king is a tyrant
because he seeks his own profit. Obviously, this corruption is the worst, for the worst is contrary to the
best. But a ruler deviates from a monarchy into tyranny, for the perversion of a monarchy is tyranny, and
a wicked king becomes a tyrant.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But aristocracy degenerates into an oligarchy through the wickedness of rulers who do not distribute the
goods of the state according to merit but usurp all or most of them for themselves; and who always keep
the same people in office, aiming at riches for the most part. As a result a few men, and those evil, gain
control in place of the very virtuous.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">And timocracy deteriorates into democracy with which it is coterminous, for timocracy is also the rule
of the masses, and all who own property are equal. Nevertheless, democracy has a minimum of
perversion, as it departs very little from the character of the polity. Consequently, these are the ways in
which polities are most easily transferred, being the least in degree and easiest to make.</span></p>

kinds of persons.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1672. After the Philosopher has explained that the species of friendship are reducible to civic or political
association, he now distinguishes them according to the divisions of political association. On this point
he does two things. First he distinguishes the species of friendship according to the divisions of political
association or states. Then [Lect. 12], at &#8220;All friendship then etc.&#8221; (B.116i1b 11), he subdivides these
kinds of friendship. He treats the first point in a twofold manner. First [I] he distinguishes the kinds of
states one from another; second [Lect. 11; II], at &#8220;Each form of etc.&#8221; (B.1161 a 10), according to these
he distinguishes the kinds of friendship. He discusses the first point under two aspects. First [I, A] he
distinguishes the kinds of states; second [I, B], at &#8220;Likenesses of these etc.,&#8221; he points out the kinds of
domestic association that resembles them. He handles the first point in a threefold manner. First [A, 1]
he indicates the forms of government; second [A, 2], at &#8220;Of these, however etc.,&#8221; he compares them; third
[A, 3], at &#8220;The perversion of kingdom etc.,&#8221; he shows how they are corrupted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1673. He says first that there are three forms of polity and just as many corruptions or violations. The
three good forms are kingdom or the rule of one; aristocracy or the government by the best, in this that
a society is governed by virtuous men. It seems fitting that there be another kind too, although some
authors do not recognize it, as is evident in the fourth book of the <i>Politics</i> (Ch. 8, 1293 b 22-1294 a 29;
St. Th. Lect. 7, 604-613). This is aptly called timocracy from <i>timos</i>&#8212;<i>timos</i> means reward&#8212;because
under this form of government rewards are bestowed on the poor when they serve in a judicial capacity
and penalties are imposed on the rich when they do not, as is clear from the fourth book of the <i>Politics</i>
(Ch. 9, 1294 a 30-1294 b 41; St. Th. Lect. 8, 614-620). Some are accustomed to call it by the common
name polity from the fact that it is common to rich and poor, as appears in the fourth book of the i (Ch.
3-4, 1289 b 27-1290 b 20; St. Th. Lect. 2, 544-556).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1674. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;Of these, however,&#8221; he compares these forms of government. He says that the best
among these is kingdom in which the best qualified man rules. The worst, i.e., the least good, is
timocracy in which many mediocre men govern. In the middle is aristocracy in which a few very good
men rule; however, their power of doing good is not so great as in the best form where one ruler has the
fullness of power.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1675. At &#8220;The perversion of kingdom&#8221; [A, 3] he treats of the corruptions or perversions of these political
systems. First [A, 3, a] about the corruptions of kingdom; second [A, 3, b], at &#8220;But aristocracy
degenerates etc.,&#8221; about the corruption of aristocracy; third [A, 3, c], at &#8220;And timocracy deteriorates etc.,&#8221;
about the corruption of timocracy. He explains the first point under two headings. First he states his
intent, saying that perversion or corruption of kingdom is called tyranny. He makes this clear first by the
fact that they agree in kind, for both are forms of monarchy, i.e.. rule by one. Just as one man governs
in a kingdom so also in a tyranny.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1676. Then he indicates the difference between them, saying that they are vastly different. It seems that
they are contraries since contraries are things that differ greatly and are in the same genus. He manifests
this difference by saying that a tyrant in his government aims at what is, useful to himself, but a king
strives&#8217; for what is beneficial to his subjects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1677. He proves this by the fact that a ruler cannot truly be called a king who is not of himself adequate
to rule, that is, excelling in all goods both of soul and body and external things, so he is worthy and able
to govern. But when he is so endowed he needs nothing, so will not work for his own interest, which the
poor characteristically do, but rather for the benefit of his subjects&#8212;as the affluent do. A man not
excelling in all goods can better be called <i>clerotos</i>, as if chosen by lot to rule, than king. But a tyrant is
the very contrary of a king because he seeks his own profit. So obviously this corruption is the worst, for
the worst is contrary to the best. But a ruler deviates from a kingship that is best, as we have noted
(1676), to a tyranny that is nothing else than a perversion of monarchy or one-man rule; and when a king
becomes wicked he is called a tyrant. Hence it is evident that tyranny is the worst perversion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1678. Next [A, 3, b], at &#8220;But aristocracy,&#8221; he treats of the perversion of aristocracy, saying that an
aristocracy degenerates into an oligarchy which is the government of a few. This happens by the
wickedness of the rulers not distributing the goods of the state according to merit but usurping all or the
greater part of them for themselves; and always keeping the same people in office, aiming especially at
enriching themselves and their friends. By reason of this a few evil men come into power in place of very
good men who rule in an aristocracy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1679. At &#8220;And timocracy deteriorates&#8221; [A, 3, c] he treats of the perversion of timocracy, saying it
deteriorates into democracy, which is rule of the populace. In fact these two are coterminous or bordering
upon one another, for they are alike in two ways. First, because timocracy or government of rewards is
likewise the rule of the masses, just as democracy is. Second, in both forms of government all who
occupy places of honor are equal. On the other hand they differ because in a timocracy the common good
of the rich and the poor is intended, but in a democracy the good of the poor alone is aimed at. Hence the
perversion inherent in democracy is the least, for it departs very little from timocracy which is a kind of
good government.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1680. He concludes then that these forms of government change very much from one to another, and so
are easily perverted, as has been pointed out (1675-1679).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1681. Then [I, B], at &#8220;Likenesses of these very forms&#8217; &#8220; he distinguishes between states and households
according to resemblances to these forms (of rule). First [B, 1] he shows what among them corresponds
to a kingdom and a tyranny; second [B, 2], at &#8220;But the authority etc.,&#8221; what corresponds to aristocracy
and oligarchy; third [B, 3], at &#8220;Among brothers etc.,&#8221; what corresponds to timocracy and democracy. He
discusses the first point under three aspects. First [i, a] he states his intent, saying that a model and
example of these forms of government can be found in domestic affairs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1682. Next [i, b], at &#8220;Certainly the association etc.&#8221; he shows which domestic relation corresponds to a
kingdom. He states that association between a father and his sons resembles a kingship because a father
has care of his sons, as a king of his subjects. Hence Homer calls Jove &#8220;father&#8221; because of his royal
power. Indeed the rule of a father in his home is a kind of kingship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1683. Third [i, c], at &#8220;With the Persians,&#8221; he shows what corresponds to household tyranny. He
distinguishes two kinds. The first is the way Persian fathers look upon sons; for they treat their sons as
slaves. The second is the way masters manage slaves; masters intend their own profit in the use of slaves.
However, these two procedures differ, for the one in which masters employ slaves for their usefulness
seems to be right. But the other in which fathers use their sons as slaves seems to be wrong. The reason
is that completely different persons should be governed in different ways. Consequently, it is wrong for
a man to govern children and slaves in the same manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1684. At &#8220;But the authority&#8221; [B, 2] he shows what in households corresponds to aristocracy and its
opposite. He treats his point in a twofold manner. First [2, a] he shows what corresponds to aristocracy.
He says that the authority by which a husband and a wife govern a household is aristocratic because the
husband has dominion and charge over the affairs that pertain to him according to his dignity and he
hands over to the wife those matters that pertain to her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1685. Second [2, b], at &#8220;On the other hand,&#8221; he states two procedures corresponding to oligarchy. One
occurs when the husband wants to arrange everything and leaves the wife in charge of nothing. This does
not accord with his dignity nor with what is best. The other procedure exists when wives have complete
authority because they are heiresses, and then their authority does not arise from their excellence but
from their riches and power, as in an oligarchy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1686. Third [B, 3], at &#8220;Among brothers&#8221; he shows what corresponds to timocracy and its opposite. First
[B, 3, a], what corresponds to timocracy. He says that the authority wielded by brothers in a household
seems to be timocratic because brothers are equal except for difference in their ages; if their ages are far
apart, their friendship seems to be in a way paternal and not fraternal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1687. Then [B, 3, b], at &#8220;Democracy, however,&#8221; he shows what corresponds to democracy. He states that
a resemblance to democracy exists in groups living together who have no director&#8212;companions staying
at an inn, for instance. There all are on the same footing; if anyone has authority it is weak, for example,
the one in charge of paying expenses. Each member has power in the dwelling, as in a democracy each
individual has quasi-equal power and the directors can do little.</span></p>

any justice; for the subject is like a tool to an artisan, the body to the soul, a slave to a master. These
objects are benefitted by the things that use them. But lifeless instruments are not subjects for friendship
(or justice); nor are horses or cattle; neither is a master a friend to a slave qua slave, for they have nothing
in common. In fact a slave is a living tool, and a tool a lifeless slave.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1688. After the Philosopher has~distinguished the kinds of political and domestic association, he now
[II] distinguishes the corresponding kinds of friendships. He discusses this point in a twofold manner.
First [II, A] he states his intent. He says each form of government and political order apparently involves
a kind of friendship from the fact that in every polity a kind of justice is found. But friendship and justice
are in some way concerned with the same matters, as we have indicated (1658, 1664).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1689. Second [II, B], at &#8220;The friendship,&#8221; he explains his statement: first [B, 1] in regard to good forms
of government; next [B, 2], at &#8220;On the other hand etc.,&#8221; in regard to evil systems. He treats the first point
under three headings. First [i, a] he shows how friendship can exist on the basis of kingdom; then [i, b],
at &#8220;But the friendship etc.,&#8221; on the basis of aristocracy; last [i, c], at &#8220;Friendship between brothers etc.,&#8221;
on the basis of timocracy. On the first point he does two things. First [a, i] he shows how friendship may
exist between a king and his subjects. Second [a, ii], at &#8220;Such too is etc.,&#8221; he compares a father&#8217;s
friendship with a king&#8217;s. He says first that by reason of benefit a superabundant friendship exists between
a king and his subjects, as between a benefactor and a beneficiary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It is proper to a king to confer benefits on his subjects, for if he is a good ruler he takes care that they
perform good deeds, and strives to make his subjects virtuous. Hence, inasmuch as he leads his subjects
as a shepherd his flock, he is even given the title. Thus Homer called King Agamemnon shepherd of his
people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1690. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;Such too is,&#8221; he compares paternal with regal friendship. He considers four aspects
of this point. First [ii, w] he compares a father&#8217;s friendship with a king&#8217;s, saying that the friendship of
a father is like that of a king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1691. Second [ii, x], at &#8220;These friendships, though &#8216; &#8220; he shows the difference between the two
friendships, noting that they differ in greatness of benefits. Although the benefaction of a king absolutely
speaking is greatest insofar as it extends to all the people, nevertheless the benefaction of a father is
greater in relation to one person. A father is the cause of the son&#8217;s three greatest goods. First, by
generation he is the cause of the son&#8217;s existence (considered the greatest good); second, by upbringing,
of his rearing; third, of his instruction. These three goods are attributed not only to fathers in regard to
their sons but also to the ancestors, viz., the grandfathers and the great-grand fathers in regard to their
grandsons and great-grandsons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1692. Third [ii, y], at &#8220;Likewise, by nature,&#8221; he proves his statement that the friendship of a father is like
a king&#8217;s. By nature a father is the ruler of his son and an ancestor of his descendants, just as a king is a
ruler of his subjects. Consequently, sons are under the dominion of their father,&#8212;and grandsons, of their
grandfather, just as subjects are under the dominion of their king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1693. Fourth [ii, z], at &#8220;Friendships of this type,&#8221; he shows the basis of agreement for all such
friendships. He states two common features: one, that they all consist in a kind of excellence of one
person over the other. Since this is obvious in the case of a king and his subjects, he manifests it
concerning fathers and sons. Because the father greatly excels, parents are honored by their sons; for
honor is due to one who excels-as we pointed out in the first book (214).and the same must be said of
ancestors. The other feature is that in friendships of this nature the same thing is not just on the part of
each. The king, therefore, must not do the same for his subject as the subj ect must do for his king, nor
the father the same for his son as the son for his father. But what is just must be judged for both parties
according to worth so that each does for the other what is proper, because in this way friendship between
them entails one loving the other in a fitting manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1694. Next [1, b], at &#8220;But the friendship,&#8221; he shows that there is a friendship corresponding to
aristocracy. He says that friendship betwen husband and wife is similar to that found in an aristocracy
in which a few are entrusted with authority by reason of excellence, on account of which they are loved.
Since those in authority are better qualified, more good is attributed to them inasmuch as they are
esteemed above others; and nevertheless what is proper to each is assigned to him. Indeed virtuous men
constituted in power do not take from their subjects the good that belongs to them. By this procedure
justice is preserved in accordance with aristocracy; and the same is true in a friendship between a
husband and wife. The husband, being more worthy, is placed over the wife; however, the husband does
not direct the affairs belonging to the wife.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1695. At &#8220;Friendship between brothers&#8221; [1, c] he shows how friendship is understood in accordance with
timocracy. He states that friendship between brothers is similar to <i>etairiciae</i>, i.e., friendship between
persons of the same age, for brothers are equal and alike in age. Persons of this kind have the same
training and habits for the most part because habits follow the way of living, as was indicated in the
second book (248, 315). From this there appears an obvious likeness between such a friendship and
friendship corresponding to timocracy in which citizens, who are in control, are equal and fair or
virtuous. Hence it is just that they rule in turn so that one does not have all the power but a part of it,
which makes them equal in power. So too is the friendship among them. This is also clearly observed in
friendship among those who are brothers and of a like age or upbringing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1696. Then [B, 2], at &#8220;On the other hand,&#8221; he shows how there is friendship corresponding to corrupt
forms of government. He discusses this point under three aspects. First [2, a] he shows that in such
systems there is very little friendship; second [2, b], at &#8220;It is minimal etc.,&#8221; he shows in which of these
the least friendship exists; third [2, c], at &#8220;In democracies, however etc.,&#8221; he shows in which of these
most friendship exists. He says first that, as there is little justice in perversions, i.e., corrupt forms of rule,
so also there is little friendship, for this in some way concerns the same thing as justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1697. Next [2, b], at &#8220;It is minimal;&#8217; he shows in which corrupt political system friendship is minimal.
On this point he does three things. First.[b, i] he states his proposition; second [b, ii], at &#8220;In those regimes
etc.,&#8221; he proves it; third [b, iii], at &#8220;Consequently, there can be etc.,&#8221; he shows how the statement should
be understood. He says first that, since there is little friendship in corrupt regimes, it follows that there
is the least friendship in the worst regimes, viz., in tyrannies in which no friendship or very little exists.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1698. Second [b, ii], at &#8220;In those regimes,&#8221; he proves his proposition. Friendship consists in sharing in
common, as we have explained (1655-1660, 1661). Obviously then if nothing is shared between ruler and
ruled-as when the ruler aims at his own good&#8212;no friendship can exist between them; nor can there be
any justice between them inasmuch as the ruler usurps for himself all the good due to the subject. But
this happens under tyranny because the tyrant does not strive for the common good but for his own. Thus
he acts with his subjects -like a workman with a tool, a soul with the body, or a master with a slave, for
the tyrant uses his subjects as slaves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1699. These three objects just mentioned are benefitted by the persons who use them, to the extent that
the objects are moved, i.e., the slave by the master, the body by the soul, the tool by the workman.
However, those who use things do not have friendship toward them. Even if they somehow benefit the
things, they intend by this the good of the things only as it is related to their own good. This is
particularly obvious of an artisan in relation to lifeless instruments which are not objects of friendship
or justice because they do not share in the activity of human life. Indeed horses and cattle are not objects
of friendship though they do have life. So, too, a master does not have friendship with a slave because
they share nothing, but all the good of the slave is the master&#8217;s as all the good of a tool is the artisan&#8217;s.
In fact a slave is, as it were, a living tool and conversely a tool is, as it were, a lifeless slave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1700. Third [b, iii], at &#8220;Consequently, there can be,&#8221; he shows how his statement (1699) is to be taken.
He says that according to the premises there is no friendship of a master for a slave <i>qua</i> slave, although
there is friendship for him precisely as man. A friendship can exist between any two men inasmuch as
they can share some thing according to law or arrangement, i.e., agreement or promise. In this way a
master can have friendship with a slave as a human being. Thus it is obvious that under tyranny, in which
rulers use subjects as slaves, there is little friendship or justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1701. Then [2, c], at &#8220;In democracies, however,&#8221; he shows in which corrupt political system friendship
is most fully realized. He says that this occurs in democracy. In this system the rulers strive in many ways
for the general welfare inasmuch as they want the common man to be equal to the talented man, and they
aim principally at the good of the people. On the other hand an oligarchy takes a middle course since it
neither works for the good of the many like a democracy nor for the benefit of one like a tyranny but for
the good of a few.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1702. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of friendship according to the species of political
and domestic association, he now subdivides the kinds of friendships. On this point he does two things.
First [I] he states a general principle for dividing and subdividing friendships. Then [II], at &#8220;Friendships
between relatives, however etc.,&#8221; he gives special treatment to some particular kinds of friendships. He
discusses the first point under three aspects. First [I, A] he proposes a general principle for distinguishing
the kinds of friendship, concluding from the premises that all friendship consists in common participation
(<i>communicatio</i>), as has been pointed out (1698).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1703. Second [I, B], at &#8220;One may,&#8221; he distinguishes, by reason of common participation, the kinds of
friendship that seem to have less in common. He says that, according to the diversity of common
participation, friendship can be distinguished in itself and from others into consanguineous (or that
between blood relatives) and companionate (or that between comrades). Blood relatives have a common
origin, and comrades a common upbringing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1704. Third [I, C], at &#8220;But civic friendships,&#8221; according to this he distinguishes friendships that seem to
have more in common. He states that civic friendships (i.e., those among fellow tribesmen, fellow
voyagers or men sailing together) and all others of this kind (for example, between fellow soldiers or
fellow students) have more evident signs of association than the friendships of blood relatives or
comrades; for in the former we must clearly acknowledge that association is the cause of friendship.
(Friendship between fellow travelers can be placed in this category.) But the friendship of blood relatives
or comrades does not have any present and permanent mode of communicating, and so is less obvious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1705- Then [II], at &#8220;Friendships between relatives, however,&#8221; he treats in particular some kinds of
friendship: first [II, A], friendship between relatives; second [II, B], at &#8220;Between man and wife etc.,&#8221;
friendship existing between husband and wife. On the first point he does two things. First [A, 1] he
distinguishes the kinds of friendship between blood relatives. Next [A, 2], at &#8220;Children have friendship
etc.,&#8221; he points out the characteristics of each division. He discusses the first point under three headings.
First [A, 1, a] he treats a father&#8217;s friendship for his son; second [A, 1, b], at &#8220;Brothers, though etc.,&#8221; the
friendship of brothers for one another; third [A,1, c], at &#8220;Nephews, however etc.,&#8221; the friendship of other
blood relations. He handles the first point in a threefold manner. First [A, 1, a, i] he proposes in what way
paternal friendship is related to other friendships between blood relatives. He says that friendship
between blood relatives seems to have great variety, i.e., to be divided into many species by reason of
the different grades of consanguinity; nevertheless, all such friendships depend on paternal friendship
as a starting point. This will be clear from what follows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1706. Second [A, 1, a, ii], at &#8220;Parents indeed,&#8221; he gives the reason for this friendship. He says that
parents love their children as part of themselves; they are generated from the seed of their parents. Hence
the son is a separated part of the father, so to speak. Consequently this friendship is nearest to the love
of a man for himself, from which all friendship is derived, as will be indicated in the ninth book (1797).
With reason then paternal friendship is considered to be the starting point. But children love their parents
as the source of their existence, much like a separated part would love the whole from which it is
separated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1707. Third [A, 1, a, iii], at &#8220;Now parents are,&#8221; he compares a father&#8217;s friendship with a son&#8217;s. He
discusses this point in a three-fold fashion. First [iii, x] he ranks paternal friendship above filial; next [iii,
y], at &#8220;From these observations etc.,&#8221; maternal above paternal; last [iii, z], at &#8220;Undoubtedly parents etc.,&#8221;
he clarifies his statement. He gives three reasons for the initial assertion. The first is this [x, aa]. The
more a man knows the causes for love, the more reasonable it is that he love more. It has been noted
(1076) that parents love their children as part of themselves. But children love their parents as the authors
of their existence. Now fathers can know their offspring better than their children can know they are their
children, for the parents know the generative action (which produced the child) but the children do not
since they were not yet born. Hence it is reasonable for parents to love their children more than children
their parents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1708. He assigns the second reason [x, bb] at &#8220;Moreover, the procreator.&#8221; It is this. The basis for love
in every friendship of blood relatives is the relationship of one person to another. But the principal or
begetter is nearer to the begotten than the thing made to the maker or the begotten to the begetter. The
offspring is&#8212;as it were&#8212;a separated part of the procreator, as we have indicated (1706, 1707). Hence
it seems to be compared to the procreator as a separable part to the whole, for example, a tooth or a hair
or the like. But such parts, which are. separated from the whole, have an affinity to the whole because
the whole includes them in itself, and not the opposite. For that reason the whole seems not to belong to
the parts at all or to belong to them less than if the converse were the case; for even if a part pertains to
the whole, nevertheless it is not identical with the whole itself, as all the parts are included in it.
Consequently, it is reasonable that parents love their children more than children their parents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1709. He gives the third reason [x, cc] at &#8220;But length of time etc.&#8221; Obviously friendship is strengthened
with the passage of time. But it is evident that parents love their children for a greater length of time than
do children their parents. Indeed parents love their children as soon as they are born. But children love
their parents only after some time has elapsed and they attain intelligence or the use of reason, or at least
the capacity to distinguish their parents from others. For, in the beginning, children call all men fathers
and all women mothers, as mentioned in the first book of the <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 1, 184 b 12; St. Th. Lect. 1,
II). It is reasonable then for parents to love their children more than children love their parents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1710. Then [iii, y], at &#8220;From these observations,&#8221; he compares a mother&#8217;s love with a father&#8217;s. He says
that it can be clearly shown from the previous considerations why mothers love their children more than
fathers do. The first reason he gives does not need proof because mothers know better than fathers who
their children are. Likewise in regard to time, for mothers before fathers conceive the affection of love
for their children because they are more constantly in their company. But the second reason is applicable
in one part but not in the other. For the father disposes the son&#8217;s principal part, the form; and the mother
disposes the matter, as is noted in the treatise <i>De Generatione Animalium</i> (Bk. II, Ch. 1, 731 b 13 sq.).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1711. Next [iii, z], at &#8220;Undoubtedly parents love,&#8221; he clarifies what he stated in the second reason, that
children are closer to their parents than the converse. This is so because parents love their children as
themselves. Children generated by their parents are as it were the parents themselves, differing from them
only in the fact of their distinct existence. On the other hand, children love their parents not as though
they were part of their parents but as begotten by them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1712. At &#8220;Brothers, though&#8221; [A, 1, b] he explains fraternal friendship. First [A, 1, b, i] he gives the basis
of this friendship. Then [A, 1, b, ii], at &#8220;Similarity in upbringing etc.,&#8221; he shows the means of
strengthening this friendship. He remarks first that brothers love one another because they are begotten
by the same parents. Things that are identical with one and the same thing are identical in some fashion
with one another. Since then children are identical in some way with their parents, as has been observed
(1711), the children&#8217;s identity with the parents makes the children identical in some way. Consequently
we say that brothers are the same by blood, by stock, and so on. Although the parents&#8217; blood (the
common origin) is entirely the same, this identity also endures in some measure even in the children who
are separated from their parents and from one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1713. Then [A, 1, b, ii], at &#8220;Similarity in upbringing,&#8221; he explains how this friendship is strengthened.
He observes that fraternal friendship is fostered greatly by the fact that brothers are reared together and
are nearly the same age, since it is natural for people alike in years to love one another. Likewise,
companions or persons of common upbringing usually have an identical manner of life which is a cause
of mutual love. Consequently, fraternal friendship resembles friendship between comrades or persons
brought up together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1714. At &#8220;Nephews, however&#8221; [i, c] he defines the friendship of other blood relatives. He states that
nephews and other kindred are connected with one &#8216; another by relationship of generation and friendship
to the extent that they derive their origin from brothers, sons of the same parents. In fact they are called
blood relatives because they are descended from these very persons. Such people are said to be more or
less related inasmuch as they are nearer or farther removed from their procreator, i.e., original ancestor,
for the first must be the measure of all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1715. Next [A, 2], at &#8220;Children have friendship,&#8221; he indicates the characteristics of these friendships: first
[2, a], of paternal friendship; second [2, bi, at &#8220;Friendship among brothers etc.,&#8221; of fraternal friendship;
third [2, c], at &#8220;In the case etc.,&#8221; of friendship between other blood relatives. To the first friendship he
assigns two characteristics. The first [2, a, i] is that children have friendship for their parents as to a kind
of superior good. The reason is that parents are special benefactors-the cause of their children&#8217;s
existence, upbringing, and training. Man&#8217;s friendship for God is also of this nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1716. Then [2, a, ii], at &#8220;Such friendships,&#8221; he states the second characteristic. Friendship between
children and parents has pleasure and utility in a greater degree than outside friendship in proportion as
they live a life more in common. Because of this they become especially useful and pleasant to one
another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1717. At &#8220;Friendship among brothers&#8221; [2, b] he gives the characteristic of fraternal friendship. He
observes that the same features are found in friendship of brothers as in the friendship of comrades or
persons living together. And if brothers are just or virtuous and entirely alike in their habits, then
friendship is greater from this common upbringing inasmuch as they are closer to one another. This is
due to three considerations. First, to length of time, since they love each other almost as soon as they are
born. Second, to a more perfect likeness. Brothers born of the same parents seem more alike in their ways
and hence appear to have the same natural disposition; they have been reared together and trained in a
similar fashion by their parents. Third, this is due to the proof of friendship since they have put each
other to the test; and for that reason their friendship is highest and firmest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1718. Next [2, c], at &#8220;In the case,&#8221; he assigns the third characteristic of friendship between other
kinsmen. He says that matters pertaining to friendship between other kindred should be understood in
proportion to, fraternal friendship since other blood relatives are descended from brothers, as indicated
above (1714).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">171g. Then [II, B], at &#8220;Between man and wife,&#8221; he treats friendship between husband and wife. He
discusses this point under three headings. First [B, 1] he assigns the reason for this friendship. Second
[B, 2], at &#8220;Children seem to be etc.,&#8221; he points out the means that can strengthen this friendship. Third
[B, 3], at &#8220;To ask how man and wife etc.,&#8221; he answers a question. On the first point he does two things.
First [B, 1, a] he offers the proper reason for this friendship. Then [B, 1, b], at &#8220;Therefore, this etc.,&#8221; he
shows how this friendship shares the general reasons for friendship. He treats the first point from two
aspects. First [B, 1, a, il he assigns the particular reason for the friendship that is common both to man
and other animals. Next [B, 1, a, ii], at &#8220;Only to this extent etc.,&#8221; he gives another reason restricted to
men. He remarks first that a natural friendship seems to exist between man and wife. He proves this by
recourse to a higher principle; for man is by nature a political animal, and it is more natural for him to
be a &#8220;conjugal&#8221; (conjugale) animal. Aristotle presents two arguments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1720. The first is that antecedent and necessary things seem to belong to nature more completely. But
domestic society, to which the union of man and wife pertains, is antecedent to civil society; for the part
is antecedent to the whole. Domestic society is also more necessary because it is ordered to acts
necessary for life, viz., generation and nourishment. Obviously then man is inclined by nature more to
conjugal than political society. The second reason is that generation of offspring, to which the union of
man~and wife is ordered, is common to other animals and therefore follows the nature of the genus. So
it is clear that man is by nature more a conjugal than a political animal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1721. Then [B, 1, a, ii], at &#8220;Only to this extent,&#8221; he indicates the proper reason for conjugal friendship
which belongs to man alone. He concludes from the premises that pairing of male and female among
other animals exists exclusively for generation of offspring, as has been noted (1720). But union of male
and female among men occurs not only for the procreation of children but also for the functions needed
in human living. These functions&#8212;it is immediately apparent&#8212;are so divided brtween man and woman
that some are proper to the husband, like external works; and others to the wife, like sewing and other
domestic occupations. Thus mutual needs are provided for, when each contributes his own services for
the common good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1722. Obviously then conjugal friendship among men not only is natural as among other animals&#8212;where
it is directed to the work of nature, viz., generation&#8212;but also domestic as directed to a sufficiency for
family life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1723. At &#8220;Therefore, this&#8221; [B, 1, b] he shows how this friendship shares the common reasons for
friendship. He observes that from previous statements conjugal friendship obviously has utility inasmuch
as it furnishes a sufficiency for family life. Likewise it provides pleasure in the generative act, as is the
case with other animals. But when the husband and wife are virtuous, their friendship can be based on
virtue. In fact there is a virtue proper to both husband and wife that renders their friendship delightful
to each other. Clearly then friendship of this kind can be based on virtue, utility, and pleasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1724. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;Children seem,&#8221; he indicates a means of making this friendship strong. He remarks
that children seem to be a cause of a stable and lasting union. Hence, sterile couples who fail to have
children are separated more readily. In fact, divorce was granted in former times because of sterility. And
the reason for this is that children are a common good of both husband and wife whose union exists for
the sake of children. But what is common continues and preserves friendship which also consists in
sharing (<i>communicatio</i>), as has been pointed out (1702).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1725. At &#8220;To ask how man and wife&#8221; [B, 3] he answers an inquiry, viz., how a man and wife ought to
live together. He himself replies that to ask this is the same as to inquire how justice exists between man
and wife; for they ought to live together in such a way that each fulfills what is just to the other. This will
be different for different persons, for the same justice must not be observed toward friend, stranger,
comrade and disciple. Therefore, a study of this kind belongs to domestic ethics or political science.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There are three kinds of friendship, as was noted at the outset. In each of them some men are friends on
a basis of equality and others on a basis of superiority. (Virtuous people become friends, and a more
virtuous person becomes a friend of a less virtuous person; people having the same and different
usefulness become friends for pleasure or utility.) Equal friends must be equated in affection and in the
other aspects of friendship, but unequal friends must bestow something proportionate to superior merits.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But friends by reason of virtue are prompt to help one another, for this is the peculiar characteristic of
virtue and friendship. And when each person is intent on serving his friend complaints and contentions
do not occur. Indeed no one is going to inflict pain on a person who loves him and acts well towards him,
but a grateful recipient does a favor in return. Even the greater benefactor receiving what he desires will
not complain of his friend, for each seeks what is good.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Nor do complaints often occur in friendships for pleasure, for friends have simultaneously what they
desire in the enjoyment of each other&#8217;s company. And a person will appear ridiculous to complain of
another&#8217;s unpleasantness since he can terminate the relationship when he wishes.</span></p>

always are looking for something, and think they have less than their due. They complain of not receiving
as much as they need when they are so deserving. On the other hand their benefactors say they have not
sufficient to give as much as the beneficiaries want.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Now legal utility is expressed in agreements. This is either of a commercial type, in hand to hand
dealings; or of a liberal type in allowing a period of delay, though the quid pro quo is determined. In the
latter case the debt is clear and unambiguous, yet the postponement indicated a friendly attitude. For this
reason some states do not permit judicial action over such agreements but assume that people dealing in
good faith should honor it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Moral utility, however, is not expressed in definite words, but the gift is made to any other as to a friend.
But the giver expects something equal or better in return, as if he were not making a gift but a loan; and
when the exchange and repayment do not take place he will complain. This happens because all or most
men approve what is noble but choose what serves their interests. Now it is noble to confer a benefit
without expecting another in return but it is profitable to receive a benefit.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But when a person can, he should make a return worthy of what he has received, doing this of his own
accord. For a man must not make someone a friend against his will; he makes a mistake in the beginning
by accepting a gift from a person from whom he should not have taken it. Indeed the gift is not from a
real friend nor from someone acting for the sake of a real friend. In this case the recipient must arrange
payment as is done on fixed terms, and actually repay if he can; if he cannot, he is not expected to do so
even by the giver. Therefore when possible he should repay; but he should consider at the outset the
person from whom he is going to receive a benefit and the kind of benefit offered, so that he may accept
or decline the benefit.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It is uncertain, though, whether repayment should be measured by the utility to the recipient, and made
according to it, or by the kindness of the giver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.968333in; margin-left: 0.968333in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He gives the reason for the difficulty. &#8212; 1741</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">For people who receive benefits belittle them; they say they receive such as are insignificant to their
benefactors and obtainable from others. Conversely, benefactors maintain that they give the best they
have-things not to be had from others-and that they give them in times of danger and great need.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.968333in; margin-left: 0.968333in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He solves the difficulty. &#8212; 1742-1743</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, in useful friendship the measure is the utility to the receiver. For he needs the help and it is
given to him on the assumption of an equal return. Now the help of the benefactor will be only as much
as the recipient gets from it, and he must repay what he received, or even more for that would be more
generous. In friendships of virtue, however, complaints do not arise. Here the intention of the giver has
a likeness to a measure, for intention is the essential element in virtue and moral practice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1726. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of friendships, he now shows how complaints
or grumblings arise in friendships. He does this under three headings. First [i] he indicates what must be
done to avoid quarrels in friendships. Second [II], at &#8220;It is to be expected etc.,&#8221; he points out the
friendships in which quarrels occur. Third [III], at &#8220;As justice is of two kinds etc.,&#8221; he explains the cause
of quarreling. He says first there are three kinds of friendship: for virtue, for pleasure, and for utility; and
in any one of these, men can be friends on terms of equality or of merit. He takes up each kind on this
very point.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1727. A friendship for virtue may exist between equally virtuous men or between a more virtuous and
a less virtuous man; a friendship for pleasure, between equally pleasant men or between a more pleasant
and a less pleasant man; a friendship for utility may provide advantages in equal measure or in a greater
and less measure. If then friends would be equal in any kind of friendship, they must be equated both in
respect to loving--so that each loves the other equally~and in respect to the other requirements such as
the courtesies of friends. But if they were unequal each must bestow something in proportion to his
superiority or inferiority.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1728. Then [II], at &#8220;It is to be expectcd,&#8221; he points out the friendships in which quarrels occur. First [II,
A] he proposes his intention. Next [II, B], at &#8220;But friends by reason of etc..&#8221; he explains it. He observes
first that it is reasonable for complaints and quarrels-according as one friend accuses another or
complains about him-to take place either solely or especially in friendship for utility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1729. At &#8220;But friends by reason of&#8221; [II, B] he explains his intention. First [B, 1] he shows that complaint
or quarreling does not occur in friendship for virtue. Then [B, 2], at &#8220;Nor do complaints etc.,&#8221; he points
out too that it does not happen often in friendship for pleasure. Last [B, 3], at &#8220;Disputes, however etc.,&#8221;
he shows that complaining and quarreling take place frequently in utilitarian friendship. He remarks first
that virtuous friends are prompt to help one another, because doing good for a friend is the proper
function of virtue and friendship. And when each strives to serve his friend, complaints and contentions
cannot possibly arise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1730. Indeed no one wants to cause sorrow to a person who loves him and acts well towards him; but if
the recipient of a benefit is grateful he will be anxious to give another benefit in return. Although the
person who is supposedly more excellent may not receive as much as he gave, nevertheless&#8212;if allotted
what he desires&#8212;he will not complain of this friend. What both desire is the good, i.e., the proper and
honorable, and this will be the thing that does not exceed the friend&#8217;s means.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1731. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;Nor do complaints,&#8221; he explains how it is with friendship for pleasure. He says that
complaints and quarrels, though possible at times, do not arise very often in friendships based on
pleasure; for if friends enjoy one another&#8217;s company each has what he desires, viz., pleasure. For that
reason there is no place for a quarrel. But if one person does not find another pleasant it is ridiculous to
complain of him not being pleasant, since the one has it in his power not to stay in the other&#8217;s company.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1732. At &#8220;Disputes, however,&#8221; [B, 3] he indicates the case of friendship for utility, observing that this
friendship suffers especially from complaints and quarrels. For those who use one another for advantage
always want more than is given them and think they receive less than their due. Consequently, they
complain of not receiving as much as they need, especially when they are deserving of so much. But, on
the other hand, their benefactors say they haven&#8217;t enough to give what the beneficiaries want.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1733. Then [III], at &#8220;As justice is of two kinds,&#8221; he gives the reason for quarreling in friendship for
utility: first [III, A] in respect to equals; next [Lect. 14; III, B], at &#8220;Disagreements happen etc.,&#8221; in respect
to unequals (B.1163 a 24). He handles the first point in a twofold manner. First [A, 1] he assigns the
cause. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;It is uncertain, though etc.,&#8221; he brings out a difficulty. He discusses the first point
from two aspects. First [1, a] he proposes the cause of quarrels in friendship based on utility. Second [1,
b], at &#8220;But when a person etc.,&#8221; he tells how to avoid such quarrels. He treats the first point under two
headings. First [a, i] he states the cause. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;Now legal utility etc.,&#8221; he explains his statement.
He affirms first that justice is of two kinds. One is unwritten but implanted in reason and is called natural
justice by him on a previous occasion (1081) &#8216; The other is written in the law and is called legal justice
in the fifth book (1081).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1734. Likewise, utility properly acquired in friendships is of two kinds. One is moral, according as a
person provides another with help (utilitatem) in conformity with moral practice. The other is legal
utility, according as a person provides another with help in conformity with a statute of law. Now
complaints arise in useful friendships especially when an exchange of utility is not made according to
the same standard. One bestows help according to the requirements of law, but the other demands it
according to moral practice. And in this way friendship is broken up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1735. Next [a, ii], at &#8220;Now legal utility,&#8221; he clarifies his statement: first [ii, x] in regard to legal utility;
then [ii, y], at &#8220;Moral utility, however etc.,&#8221; in regard to moral utility. He notes first that legal utility is
expressed in definite words or pacts entered into by agreement of both parties. This is twofold. One is
entirely formal&#8212;after the manner of buying and selling done from hand to hand&#8212;e.g., when someone
immediately takes what is promised him for service rendered. The other is more liberal allowing a period
of delay, although the <i>quid pro quo</i> must necessarily be determined. Thus the debt is clear and
unambiguous, but the postponement of it is a kind of friendly gesture. For this reason some do not require
a judicial exercise of justice but honor their word in business dealings; and it is thought they should be
loved for this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1736. At &#8220;Moral utility, however&#8221; [ii, y] he explains what moral utility is. He says it is not expressed in
definite words or compacts made by agreement, but without any contract externally declared a person
gives to someone else what is usually given gratis to a friend. However, the man who makes a worthy
gift intends and expects in return something equal or even better, as if he were not making a gift but a
loan. But when an exchange does not take place in such a way that the recipient restores and pays equal
or more, the giver will accuse the recipient and complain of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1737. After that he assigns the cause of these actions. He remarks that what he just said, viz., the person
who gives gratis seeks a return, happens because all, or most people, wish or approve what is noble but
actually choose what serves their interests. But that a man confer a benefit on another without intending
a benefit in return is noble. Consequently, men want to appear to confer benefits in this way in order to
be acceptable to others. But it is profitable to receive benefits. Therefore, whatever else they may
pretend, men choose what is profitable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1738. Then [x, b], at &#8220;But when a person,&#8221; he shows how quarreling of this kind is to be avoided. He says
the recipient of a benefit, when he can, should make a return worthy of the gifts he has received; and he
should do this of his own accord because a man should not make someone a friend against his will, in
the sense of being willing to accept gratis from a person who is unwilling to give gratis. But the man who
accepts a benefit made a mistake in this at the outset in accepting a favor of a person from whom he
should not have taken it. For he does not receive a benefit from a real friend nor from one who bestowed
it for the sake of him to whom it was given but for an expected advantage. Hence the recipient of a
benefit ought to repay the giver on fixed terms or compacts made by agreement. And if he can return to
the giver the equal of what he received, he ought to insist on making complete repayment. But if he is
unable to repay, neither he who bestowed nor he who accepted the benefit thinks it proper to demand this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1739. We should remark then that, when possible the recipient ought to make repayment to the kind of
benefactor who is intent on repayment. But when a man accepts a benefit he ought to consider at the
beginning the person from whom he is receiving it, whether from a friend freely giving or from one who
seeks repayment. Likewise he ought to consider under what conditions he is accepting the benefit,
whether he could make a return or not, so that he may accept or decline the benefit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1740. Next [A, 2], at &#8220;It is uncertain, though&#8221; he raises a difficulty on the matters discussed. First [2, a]
he proposes the difficulty, stating it is doubtful whether the recommended repayment ought to be
measured by the utility conferred on the recipient of the benefit or by the action of the bestower of the
benefit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1741. Second [2, b], at &#8220;For people who receive etc.,&#8221; he gives the reason for the difficulty. Recipients
of bpriefits in attempting to belittle the favors obtained say they received what was only a trifle for their
benefactors, such as they themselves were able to get from others. On the contrary, though, benefactors
wanting to extol their benefits maintain that they gave the best they had, which were such as could not
be gotten from others, and that they gave these in times of danger and great need.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1742. Third [2, c], at &#8220;Therefore, in useful friendship etc.,&#8221; he solves the difficulty by saying that
repayment ought to be measured by the utility accruing to the recipient&#8217;s benefit. He is the one who
needed the benefit and it is sufficient for him to attempt an equal return. Indeed the help of the benefactor
was only as much as the receiver obtains from it; and if it effects more it is better. In friendships of virtue,
however, complaints do not arise, as has been indicated (1729-1730).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1743. Nevertheless a return must be made in them; and here the intention or will in the giver of the
benefit has a likeness to a measure, because a measure in any genus is the principal element in that genus.
But the excellence of virtue and moral practice lies in intention. For that reason, in friendship based on
virtue a return ought to be made according to the will of the person who bestowed the benefit even if
someone obtained little or no help from it.</span></p>

The more useful friend is of a similar mind, arguing that the useless man should not receive an equal
share, for we would have a kind of public benefaction and not friendship if the advantages of friendship
were not allotted according to the value of the benefits bestowed. In this view friendship ought to be
considered a business partnership: those who invest more should get bigger returns.</span></p>

community is not honored. But he who benefits the community receives a common good&#8212;honor is just
that. A person cannot expect to be honored by the community and simultaneously made rich. Indeed no
one could bear to have the smaller share in everything. But one person losing in wealth receives honor,
and another expecting gifts receives riches; thus each is equated in proportion to merit, and friendship
is preserved&#8212;as has been explained. Therefore, our friendship with unequals should be so conducted
that the friend, who benefits us in money or virtue, is recompensed in the way that is possible, namely,
in honor.</span></p>

natural friendship it is human not to refuse help. But if a son is bad he will avoid supplying his father&#8217;s
needs, or at least will not be in a hurry to do so. For the majority are willing to accept benefits but avoid
conferring them as something unprofitable This is the extent of our discussion of these questions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1744. After the Philosopher has shown the manner in which complaints arise in useful friendship
between equals, he now shows how complaints occur in friendships between unequals [III, B]. He
discusses this point under three headings. First [B, 1] he states the disagreement usually happening in
these friendships. Next [B, 2], for &#8220;For the better person etc.,&#8221; he gives the reason for disagreement. Last
[B, 3], at &#8220;Both seem etc.,&#8221; he defines the truth. He remarks first that some difference and discord among
friends exist also in friendships between unequals when each, the superior and the inferior, thinks it right
that he should have more. If he does not get it the friendship is broken up for this reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1745. Next [ B, 2 ], at &#8220;For the better person,&#8221; he offers the reason for this disagreement. First [2, a] he
states the reason motivating the superior parties; then [2, b], at &#8220;But the needy etc.,&#8221; the reason
influencing the inferior parties. He observes first that in friendship for virtue the better person thinks it
reasonable for him to receive the greater benefit; for if good is due to the good man then more good is
due to the better one. Likewise, in friendship for utility the more useful person thinks he should receive
the greater benefit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1746. It is not fitting, they contend, that he who is less useful should reccive the equal of the more useful
partner; for this would be a kind of public benefaction or service and not friendship, if the advantages
arising from friendship were not distributed according to the value of works so that the man who does
better work would have more. In fact they think that, as in business enterprises, the bigger investors
receive larger returns from the general fund, so also in friendship the person who contributes more to
friendship should receive more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1747. Then [2, b], at. &#8220;But the needy&#8221; he gives the reasons influencing the inferior parties. The needy
in useful friendship and the less worthy in virtuous friendship argue to the contrary; they maintain that
it is the role of a friend excelling in good to provide adequately for friends in need. In fact there would
not seem to be any advantage for an inferior person to have a virtuous or powerful friend if nothing ought
to be received from him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1748. At &#8220;Both seem&#8221; [B, 3] he defines the truth. First [3, a] he proposes the truth; then [3, b], at &#8220;Honor
certainly etc.,&#8221; he explains it; last [3, c], at &#8220;Therefore, a son etc.,&#8221; he deduces a corollary from the
discussion. He says first that each, the superior and inferior, seems to estimate correctly what is just,
because something more&#8212;not of the same thing though&#8212;ought to be given to each: to the superior,
greater honor, but to the needy, greater gain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 1749. Next [3, b], at &#8220;Honor certainly,&#8221; he clarifies his statement (1748): first [b, i] by argument; and
second [b, ii], at &#8220;It seems to happen etc.,&#8221; by illustration; third [b, iii], at &#8220;Friendship indeed etc.,&#8221; he
proves an assertion previously made. He notes first that more honor ought to be given to the superior
person because honor is a suitable compensation for acts of virtue and kindness&#8212;in which worthy people
excel. On the other hand, gain provides assistance against need which inferior persons feel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1750. At &#8220;It seems to happen&#8221; [b, ii] he manifests the same point by an example. We see it happen this
way in civil affairs, for the man who does not contribute any good to the community is not honored. But
he who bestows some benefit on the community is given a common good, honor. It is not easily possible
for someone to get riches and honors from the community simultaneously. Indeed no one could bear to
have the smaller share of everything, honor and riches alike. But the person who loses money by the
expenses incurred in serving the community is given honor by the state, and the person who expects gifts
for his service is given riches.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1751. It was pointed out previously (1693) that the observance and recognition of excellence creates a
proportionate equality among friends, and thus preserves friendship. As states confer honors on some and
wealth on others according to their excellence, so we must handle unequal friends. We should render
honor to one who performs a useful service by bestowing riches or who does virtuous acts; we should
do this in such a way that compensation is made&#8212;perhaps not in the equivalent but in that service which
is possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1752. Then [b, iii], at &#8220;Friendship indeed,&#8221; he proves that it is sufficient to return what is feasible. The
reason is that friendship asks of a friend what is possible but not always what is equal in value, since this
would be absolutely impossible at times. Surely not all benefits can be repaid in adequate honor, as is
obvious in honors rendered to God and parents who can never be worthily recompensed. However, if a
man serves God and parents according to his ability, he seems to be just or virtuous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1753. At &#8220;Therefore, a son&#8221; [3, c] he deduces a corollary from the discussion. First [c, i] he concludes
that it is not lawful for a son to disown his father but it is lawful sometimes for a father to disown his son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1754. Second [c, ii], at &#8220;For a debt etc.,&#8221; he clarifies his conclusion by two reasons. The first is [ii, x] that
the son being indebted to the father for the benefits received ought to repay. But he is unable to make a
repayment that the benefits deserve. Therefore he will always remain in debt. For this reason he is not
at liberty to disown his father. But creditors have the power to dismiss their debtors, so a father has the
power of dismissing his son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1755. He states the second reason at &#8220;At the same time no one&#8221; [ii, y], observing that no son seems to
forsake his father and disown him except out of excessive wickedness. Because of the natural friendship
between father and son, it is human that no one should thrust out a person who has supported him. Thus
it would be most wicked for a son to expel his father. But if a son is bad the father ought to put him out,
or at least not work hard to provide adequately for him, since the son would thereby increase in
wickedness. For the majority are willing to accept benefits but avoid assisting others as something
unprofitable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1756. He concludes by way of summary that he has discussed those questions pertaining only to the kinds
of friendship. Thus he finishes the teaching of the eighth book.</span></p>
