<hr>
<P>Let us assume, in accordance with the Catholic faith, that the world had a
beginning in time. The question still arises whether the world could have always
existed, and to explain the truth of this matter, we should first distinguish
where we agree with our opponents from where we disagree with them. If someone
holds that something besides God could have always existed, in the sense that
there could be something always existing and yet not made by God, then we differ
with him: such an abominable error is contrary not only to the faith but also to
the teachings of the philosophers, who confess and prove that everything that in
any way exists cannot exist unless it be caused by him who supremely and most
truly has existence. However, someone may hold that there has always existed
something that, nevertheless, had been wholly caused by God, and thus we ought
to determine whether this position is tenable.
<P>If it be impossible that something caused by God has always existed, it will
be so either because God could not make something that has always existed or
because such a thing could not be made, regardless of God's ability to make
it.<SUP> <A name=n3></A><A
href="#f3">[3]</A>
</SUP>As to the first, all parties agree that, in view of his infinite power,
God could have made something that has always existed.<SUP> <A name=n4></A><A
href="#f4">[4]</A>
</SUP>It remains to be seen, therefore, whether something that has always
existed can be made.
<P>If such a thing cannot be made, the impossibility will arise for one of two
reasons: either because of an absence of a passive potentiality or because of
some contradiction between the ideas involved.<SUP> <A name=n5></A><A
href="#f5">[5]</A>
</SUP>In regard to the first, notice that before an angel is made, we may say,
in a certain manner of speaking, that the angel cannot be made,<SUP> <A
name=n6></A><A
href="#f6">[6]</A>
</SUP>since no passive potentiality precedes its being, for an angel is not made
from pre-existing matter. Nevertheless, God was able to make the angel, and he
was able to cause the angel to be made, for God made it, and it was made.
Therefore, if we understand "being made" or "being caused" as implying the
pre-existence of a passive potentiality, then it should to be conceded,
according to faith, that something caused cannot always exist, for it would then
follow that a passive potentiality has always existed, and this is heretical.
But since a passive potentiality need not precede in time whatever God may make,
it does not follow that God could not have made something that has always
existed.
<P>In regard to the second, someone may hold that something that has always
existed cannot be made because such a thing is self-contradictory, just as an
affirmation and a denial cannot be made simultaneously true. Still, some people
say that God can even make self-contradictories things, while others say God
cannot make such things, for such things are actually nothing. Clearly, God
cannot make such things come to be, for the assumption that such a thing exists
immediately refutes itself. Nevertheless, if we allow that God can make such
things come to be, the position is not heretical, though I believe it is false,
just as the proposition that the past did not occur is false, about which
Augustine says (XXVI <I>Contra Faustum</I> cap. 5), "Anyone who says, 'If God is
omnipotent, let him make what has happened not to have happened,' does not
realize that he is saying, 'If God is omnipotent, let him make true things false
insofar as they are true.'" [PL 42, 481.] Nevertheless, certain great men have
piously maintained that God can make past events not to have happened, and this
was not reputed to be heretical.
<P>We thus ought to determine whether there is any contradiction between these
two ideas, namely, to be made by God and to have always existed. And, whatever
may be the truth of this matter, it will not be heretical to say that God can
make something created by him to have always existed, though I believe that if
there were a contradiction involved in asserting this, the assertion would be
false. However, if there is no contradiction involved, then it is neither false
nor impossible that God could have made something that has always existed, and
it will be an error to say otherwise. For, if there is no contradiction, we
ought to admit that God could have made something that has always existed, for
it would be clearly derogatory to the divine omnipotence, which exceeds every
thought and power, to say that we creatures can conceive of something that God
is unable to make. (Nor are sins an instance to the contrary, for, considered in
themselves, they are nothing.) In this, therefore, the entire question consists:
whether to be wholly created by God and not to have a beginning in time are
contradictory terms.
<P>That they are not contradictory can be shown as follows. If they are
contradictory, this is for one or both of these two reasons: either because the
agent cause must precede the effect in time, or because non-being must precede
the effect in time, for we say that what God creates comes to be out of nothing.

<P>First, we should show that it is not necessary that an agent cause, in this
case God, precede in time that which he causes, if he should so will. This can
be shown in several ways. First, no cause instantaneously producing its effect
necessarily precedes the effect in time. God, however, is a cause that produces
effects not through motion but instantaneously. Therefore, it is not necessary
that he precede his effects in time. The first premise is proved inductively
from all instantaneous changes, as, for example, with illumination and other
such things. But the premise may be proved by reason as well.
<P>For, at whatever instant a thing exists, at that instant it can begin to act,
as is clear in the case of all things that come to be by generation: in the very
instant at which there is fire, the fire heats. But in an instantaneous action,
the beginning and the end of the action are simultaneous, indeed identical, as
is clear in the case of all indivisible things. Hence, at whatever moment an
agent instantaneously producing an effect exists, the end of its action can
exist as well. The end of the action, however, is simultaneous with the thing
made. Therefore, there is no contradiction if we suppose that a cause
instantaneously producing an effect does not precede its effect in time. A
contradiction does obtain if the cause involved is one that produces its effects
through motion, for the beginning of the motion precedes in time the end of the
motion. Since people are accustomed to considering the type of cause that
produces effects through motion, they do not easily grasp that an agent cause
may fail to precede its effect in time, and so, having limited experience, they
easily make a false generalization.
<P>Nor can the conclusion be avoided by saying that God is an agent cause that
acts voluntarily, for neither the will nor the voluntary agent need precede its
effect in time, unless the agent cause acts from deliberation, which we take to
be absent in God.
<P>Further, a cause that produces the whole substance of a thing does not, in
producing a whole substance, act in a less perfect way than does a cause that
produces just a form in producing the form. On the contrary, it acts in a much
more perfect way, since it does not act by educing from the potentiality of
matter, as do causes that merely produce forms. However, some causes that
produce just forms are such that, whenever the cause exists, the form produced
by it exists as well, as is clear in the case of illumination by the sun.
Therefore, much more can God, who produces the whole substance of things, make
something caused by him exist whenever he himself exists.
<P>Further, if, granted a cause, its effect does not immediately exist as well,
this can only be because something complementary to that cause is lacking: the
complete cause and the thing caused are simultaneous. God, however, never lacks
any kind of complementary cause in order to produce an effect. Therefore, at any
instant at which God exists, so too can his effects, and thus God need not
precede his effects in time.
<P>Further, the will of the voluntary agent in no way diminishes his power, and
this is especially true with God. But all those who try to answer the arguments
of Aristotle (who held that something caused by God had always existed, since
like always makes like) <A name=n7></A><A
href="#f7">[7]</A>
say that the conclusion would follow if God were not a voluntary agent.
Therefore, allowing that God is a voluntary agent, it still follows that he can
make something that he has made never fail to exist. Thus, although God cannot
make contradictories true, we have shown that there is no contradiction in
saying that an agent cause does not precede its effect in time.
<P>It remains to be seen, then, whether there is a contradiction in saying that
something made has always existed, on the grounds that it may be necessary that
its non-being precede it in time, for we say that it is made out of nothing. But
that there is no contradiction here is shown by Anselm in his explanation of
what it means to say that a creature is made out of nothing. He says
(<I>Monologion</I> cap. 8), "The third sense in which we can say that something
is made out of nothing is this: we understand that something is made, but that
there is not something from which it is made. In a similar way, we say that
someone who is sad without reason is sad about nothing. We can thus say that all
things, except the Supreme Being, are made by him out of nothing in the sense
that they are not made out of anything, and no absurdity results." On this
understanding of the phrase "out of nothing," therefore, no temporal priority of
non-being to being is posited, as there would be if there were first nothing and
then later something.
<P>Further, let us even suppose that the preposition "out of" imports some
affirmative order of non-being to being, as if the proposition that the creature
is made out of nothing meant that the creature is made after nothing. Then this
expression "after" certainly implies order, but order is of two kinds: order of
time and order of nature. If, therefore, the proper and the particular does not
follow from the common and the universal, it will not necessarily follow that,
because the creature is made after nothing, non-being is temporally prior to the
being of the creature. Rather, it suffices that non-being be prior to being by
nature. Now, whatever naturally pertains to something in itself is prior to what
that thing only receives from another. A creature does not have being, however,
except from another, for, considered in itself, every creature is nothing, and
thus, with respect to the creature, non-being is prior to being by nature. Nor
does it follow from the creature's always having existed that its being and
non-being are ever simultaneous, as if the creature always existed but at some
time nothing existed, for the priority is not one of time. Rather, the argument
merely requires that the nature of the creature is such that, if the creature
were left to itself, it would be nothing. For example, if we should say that the
air has always been illuminated by the sun, it would be right to say that the
air has always been made lucid by the sun. Thus, since anything that comes to be
such-and-such comes to be such-and-such from being not such-and-such, we say
that the air is made lucid from being non-lucid, or opaque, not because the air
was once non-lucid or opaque, but because the air would be opaque if the sun did
not illuminate it. This is clearly the case with the stars and those celestial
bodies that are always illuminated by the sun.
<P>Thus it is clear that there is no contradiction in saying that something made
by God has always existed. Indeed, if there were some contradiction, it would be
amazing that Augustine failed to see it, for exposing such a contradiction would
be a most effective way of proving that the world is not eternal, and although
Augustine offers many arguments against the eternity of the world in XI and XII
<I>De Civitate Dei</I>, he never argues that his opponents' view is
contradictory. On the contrary, Augustine seems to hint that there is no
contradiction involved. Thus, speaking of the Platonists, he says (X <I>De
Civitate Dei</I> cap. 31), "They somehow contemplate a beginning in causation
rather than a beginning in time. Imagine, they say, a foot that has been in dust
since eternity: a footprint has always been beneath it, and nobody would doubt
that the footprint was made by the pressure of the foot. Though neither is prior
in time to the other, yet one is made by the other. Likewise, they say, the
world and the gods in it have always existed, just as he who made them always
existed; yet nevertheless, they were made." [PL 41, 311] Nor does Augustine ever
say that this cannot be understood; rather, he proceeds against the Platonists
in a totally different way. He says (XI <I>De Civitate Dei</I> cap. 4), "Those,
however, who admit that the world was made by God but nevertheless want to hold
that the world has a beginning in creation but not in time, so that, in some
scarcely intelligible way, it has always been made by God, think that they are
defending God against a charge of casual rashness." [PL 41, 319]<A
name=n8></A><A
href="#f8">[8]</A>
Their position is difficult to understand, however, only for the reason given
above in the first argument.
<P>How remarkable it would be that even the most noble of philosophers failed to
see a contradiction in the idea that something made by God has always existed.
Speaking against the Platonists, Augustine says (XI <I>De Civitate Dei</I> cap.
5), "Here we are contending with those who agree with us that God is the Creator
of all bodies and all natures except himself," [PL 41, 320] and then, again
about the Platonists, he adds (XI <I>De Civitate Dei</I> cap. 5), "These
philosophers surpassed the rest in nobility and authority." [PL 41, 321]
Augustine said this even after diligently considering their position that the
world has always existed, for they nevertheless thought that it was made by God,
and they saw no contradiction between these two ideas. Therefore, those who so
subtly perceive the contradiction are solitary men, and with these does wisdom
arise. <A name=n9></A><A
href="#f9">[9]</A>
<P>Still, since certain authorities seem to argue on the side of such men, we
ought to show that they base themselves on a weak foundation. Damascene says (I
<I>De Fide Orthodoxa</I> cap. 8), "What is made out of nothing is by nature not
such that it is coeternal to what has no causal principle and always exists."
[PG 94, 814B] Likewise, Hugh of St. Victor says (<I>De Sacramentis</I> I-1 cap.
1), "The ineffable omnipotent power could not have anything coeternal beyond
itself that would help it in making." [PL 176, 187B]
<P>But the position of these and similar authorities is made clear by Boethius,
who says (V <I>De Consolatione</I> prosa 6), "When some people hear that Plato
thought this world neither had a beginning in time nor will ever have an end,
they mistakenly conclude that the created world is coeternal with the Creator.
However, to be led through the endless life Plato attributes to the world is one
thing; to embrace simultaneously the whole presence of endless life is quite
another, and it is this latter that is proper to the divine mind." [PL 63, 859B]
Thus it does not follow, as some people object, that a creature, even if it had
always existed, would be equal to God in duration. For, if "eternal" be
understood in this sense, nothing can in any way be coeternal with God, for
nothing but God is immutable. As Augustine says (XII <I>De Civitate Dei</I> cap.
15), <A name=n10></A><A
href="#f10">[10]</A>
"Time, since it passes away by its mutability, cannot be coeternal with
immutable eternity. Thus, even if the immortality of the angels does not pass
away in time (it is neither past, as if it did not exist now; nor is it future,
as if it did not yet exist), nevertheless, the angels' motions, by which moments
of time are carried along from the future into the past, pass away. Therefore,
angels cannot be coeternal with the Creator, in whose motion there is nothing
which has been that is not now, nor anything which will later be that is not
already." [PL 41, 364-365] Likewise, Augustine says (VIII <I>Super Genesis ad
Litteram</I> cap. 23), "Since the nature of the Trinity is wholly unchangeable,
it is eternal in such a way that nothing can be coeternal with it," [PL 34, 389]
and he uses words to the same effect in XI <I>Confessionum</I> as well. <A
name=n11></A><A
href="#f11">[11]</A>

<P>Those who try to prove that the world could not have always existed even
adduce arguments that the philosophers have considered and solved. Chief among
these is the argument from the infinity of souls: if the world had always
existed, these people argue, there would necessarily be an infinite number of
souls. But this argument is not to the point, for God could have made the world
without making men or creatures with souls, or he could have made men when in
fact he did make them, even if he had made the rest of the world from eternity.
In either case, an infinite number of souls would not remain after the bodies
had passed away. Furthermore, it has not yet been demonstrated that God cannot
cause an infinite number of things to exist simultaneously.
<P>There are other arguments adduced as well, but I refrain from answering them
at present, either because they have been suitably answered elsewhere, or
because they are so weak that their very weakness lends probability to the
opposing view.
