<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#8220;He protected the camp with his sword&#8221; (1 Macc. 3:3)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. &#8211; This passage is appropriate to the subject matter of this letter to the Colossians, because this
present life is a battle waged by soldiers who live in a camp: &#8220;The life of man on earth is a war&#8221;
(Job 7:1). And so the place where the faithful live is called a camp. And the Church is like a
camp: &#8220;This is the camp of God&#8221; (Gen 32:2). This camp is attacked in three ways. First, by those
aggressors who openly rise against the Church: &#8220;They marched up over the broad earth and
surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city&#8221; (Rev. 20:9). Secondly, this camp is
deceitfully undermined by heretics: &#8220;By fair and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the
simple-minded&#8221; (Rom 16:18); &#8220;Evil men and imposters; will go from bad to worse, deceivers
and deceived&#8221; (2 Tim 3:13). Thirdly, it is attacked by some of its own members who have
become depraved from sins that spring from the corruption of the flesh: &#8220;The desires of the flesh
are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh&#8221; as we read in Galatians
(5:17); &#8220;For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against
the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness&#8221; (Eph 6:12). In this war the prelates
of the Church are our leaders: according to the Psalm &#8220;The princes of Judah are their leaders&#8221; (Ps
68:27). It is their duty to protect the camp of the Church against all these attacks. First, against
sins, by encouraging the people: &#8220;Declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob
their sins&#8221; (Is 58:1). Secondly, against heretics, by their sound teaching: &#8220;He must hold firm to
the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to
confute those who contradict it&#8221; (Tit 1:9). Thirdly, they should protect the Church against those
who persecute it by giving an example of patient suffering. This is the way Paul protected the
Church with his spiritual sword, because in his letters he combated sin, refuted heresies, and
encouraged patience. As to the first: &#8220;But immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not
even be named among you, as is fitting among saints&#8221; (Eph 5:3). As to the second: &#8220;As for a man
that is factious, after admonishing him once or twice, have nothing more to do with him&#8221; (Tit
3:10). As to the third, the entire eleventh chapter of his second letter to the Corinthians shows
how he encouraged them to be patient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. &#8211; The passage quoted at the beginning mentions two of these matters: the condition of the
Church, when it says, camp, and the zeal of the Apostle, when it says, protected. Now a camp has
to be alert in order to avoid evil: &#8220;Your camp must be holy&#8221; (Dt. 23:14); and it should have a
good relationship with its leader and in itself: &#8220;This is the camp of God&#8221; (Gen. 32:21). It should
also be a threat to the enemy: &#8220;Terrible as an army with banners&#8221; (Sg. 6:10). Now the Apostle
was alert in protecting them, like a shepherd, whose duty is to carefully lead his sheep so they
are not lost. &#8220;He goes before them, and the sheep follow him&#8221; (Jn. 10:4). The Apostle did act this
way: &#8220;Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:16). A shepherd should also feed his flock
generously, so they do not become ill: &#8220;Tend the flock of God that is your charge&#8221; (1 Pet. 5:2).
And the Apostle did this also: &#8220;I fed you with milk&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:2). A shepherd should also bravely
defend his flock, so they will not be destroyed: &#8220;Do not seek to become a judge, lest you be
unable to remove iniquity&#8221; (Sir. 7:6); &#8220;Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and when
there came a lion or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, I went after him and delivered it out
of his mouth&#8221; (1 Sam. 17:34). And so our beginning text says that the Apostle protected the
camp, that is, God&#8217;s Church, with a sword, which is the word of God: &#8220;The word of God is living
and active, sharper then any two-edged sword&#8221; (Heb. 4:12). Here, then, is the subject matter of
this letter. In his letter to the Ephesians, the Apostle described the nature of the Church&#8217;s unity;
and in the letter to the Philippians, he showed its growth and preservation. But in this letter he
is dealing with its protection from those heretics who were corrupting and misleading the
Colossians.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="11"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Col. 1:1-2</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 2
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace
from God our Father.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. &#8211; This letter is divided into its greeting and its message (1:3). First, the persons sending the
letter are mentioned; then, the ones to whom it is sent (1:2); and thirdly, the good things desired
for the latter (1:2b). As to the first, the principal sender is mentioned; and secondly, his
companion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. &#8211; The principal sender of this letter is first identified by his name, Paul, that is, one who is
humble, for it is such persons who receive wisdom: &#8220;Thou hast hidden these things from the wise
and understanding and revealed them to babes&#8221; (Mt 11:25), and so Paul can teach this wisdom.
Secondly, the sender is described by his office, namely, an apostle, that is, one who is sent, to
bring salvation to the faithful: &#8220;Set apart for me Saul and Barnabas for the work to which I have
called them&#8221; (Acts 13:2); &#8220;As the Father has sent me, even so I send you&#8221; (Jn 20:21). He is not
the apostle of just anyone, but of Christ Jesus, whose glory he seeks, and not his own: &#8220;For what
we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&#8217;
sake&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:5). But at times some reach their office because God is angry because of a
people&#8217;s sins: &#8220;Who makes a man who is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people&#8221; (Job
34:30); &#8220;I have given you kings in my anger&#8221; (Hos 13:11). And so Paul says that he has his office
by the will of God, that is, by his pleasure: &#8220;I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who
will feed you with knowledge and understanding&#8221; (Jer 3:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. &#8211; The other person to send this letter is Timothy our brother, so that there may be two or three
witnesses, as in Deuteronomy (17:6). &#8220;A brother helped is like a strong city&#8221; (Pr 18:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. &#8211; The persons to whom this letter is sent are the saints and faithful brethren at Colossae. The
greater ones are called saints: &#8220;Let us serve him in holiness and righteousness&#8221; (Lk 1:74); and
the lesser ones are referred to as the faithful, who have at least kept the true faith, because
&#8220;without faith it is impossible to please God&#8221; (Heb 11:6). Or we could say, to the saints, that is,
to those sanctified by baptism, and faithful brethren, that is, those who have remained in the faith
they accepted: &#8220;A faithful man will be much praised,&#8221; as we read in Proverbs (28:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. &#8211; Then he mentions the good things he wishes them to have: that is, grace, which is the source
of every good: &#8220;Justified by his grace as a gift&#8221; (Rom 3:24); and peace, which is the last of all
goods: &#8220;He makes peace in your borders&#8221; (Ps 147:14). As a consequence, he wishes them all the
goods that lie between these two. &#8220;The Lord will give grace and glory&#8221; (Ps 84:11). From the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, the Father of Christ by nature, and our Father by grace;
and from the Lord Jesus Christ [Vulgate]. And so, from our Father, that is, God in his Trinity,
and from the Lord Jesus Christ, considering the nature God assumed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="12"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Col. 1: 3-8</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for
you, 4 because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which
you have for all the saints, 5 because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of
this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel 6 which has come
to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing&#8212;so among
yourselves, from the day you heard and understood the grace of God in truth, 7
as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful
minister of Christ on your behalf 8 and has made known to us your love in the
Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. &#8211; Here Paul begins his message. First, he commends the truth of the Gospel; secondly, he
defends this against those who attack it (in the second chapter). In regard to the first he does two
things. First, he commends the truth of faith in the Gospel; and secondly, its Author (1:15), The
first is divided into two parts. First, he thanks God for the benefits conferred on the Colossians
in particular; and secondly, for those benefits granted to the Church in general (1:12). In regard
to the first he does two things. First, he thanks God, and secondly, he shows why he gives thanks
(1.14). Again the first is divided into two parts. First, he gives thanks; secondly, he prays (13b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. &#8211; So he says: We thank God, the Author of grace: &#8220;Give thanks in all circumstances&#8221; (1 Th
5:18). And we thank God always, for the past and for the future. For although we cannot actually
pray every minute, we should always pray by serving God out of love: &#8220;Pray constantly&#8221; (1 Th
5:17); &#8220;We ought always to pray&#8221; (Lk 18:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">10. &#8211; Then he states his reasons for giving thanks. First, he recalls the blessings they have; and
secondly, how they were obtained (1:5b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11. &#8211; Our blessings or goods consist especially in faith, hope, and the love of charity: for by faith
we have a knowledge of God; by hope we are raised up to him; but by the love of charity we are
united to him. As we read: &#8220;So faith, hope, love, abide, these three; but the greatest of these is
love&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:13). So he gives thanks for these three. First, that they have the faith; although
he was not the one who preached to them, but rather a disciple by the name of Epaphras, and later
Archippus. Thus he says, we have heard of your faith, which is the beginning of the spiritual life:
&#8220;The righteous shall live by his faith&#8221; (Hab 2:4); &#8220;For whoever would draw near to God must
believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him&#8221; (Heb 11:6). But this faith is dead
without an active love, as James says (2:26), and so an active love must also be present: &#8220;For in
Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation&#8221;
(Gal 6:15). And so he continues, and of the love which you have for all the saints. There is a love
which springs from charity, and another which is worldly. This worldly love does not include
everyone, because we love those with whom there is some communication or sharing, which is
the cause of love; but in worldly love this cause is not present in everyone, but is only found in
one&#8217;s relatives or other worldly people. But the love of charity does extend to everyone; and so
he says, for all. For even though sinners are loved by the love of charity, it is in order that at some
time they become holy: &#8220;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love
the brethren&#8221; (1 Jn 3:14). Further, the fruit of worldly love is obtained in this world; but the fruit
of the love of charity is in eternal life. This leads him to mention hope: because of the hope laid
up for you in heaven, that is, because of your eternal glory, which is called hope because it is
considered as certain: &#8220;This hope has been put in my heart,&#8221; as we read in Job (19:27) [Vulgate].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">12. &#8211; Then (1:5b), he shows how they obtained these things. First, he commends the doctrine of
the Gospel; and secondly, its ministry. First he commends the truth of the doctrine; secondly, its
growth (v. 6); thirdly, its fruitful progress (v. 6b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">13. &#8211; So he says, of this you have heard, that is, of the hope or else of the things hoped for, in the
word of the truth, the Gospel, for this is greater than everything else: &#8220;Eye has not seen, nor ear
heard, nor the heart of man conceived what God has prepared for those who love him&#8221; (1 Cor.
2:9). Therefore, God revealed this: &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand&#8221; (Mt 3:2). But
his hope is true, and not a vain hope (as when the one promising is a liar), because it is in the
word of the truth: &#8220;Your word is truth&#8221; (Jn 17:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">14. &#8211; Then when he says, which has come to you, Christ&#8217;s doctrine is commended for its growth,
because it has come not only to you, but is indeed in the whole world: &#8220;Their voice goes out
through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world&#8221; (Ps 19:4); &#8220;This Gospel of the
kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world ... and then the end will come&#8221; (Mt
24:14). But since the Gospel has been preached in the whole world, why has the end not come?
I answer that some say that the Gospel of Christ is not the Gospel of the kingdom. But this is
false, because our Lord calls it the Gospel of the kingdom. And so, according to Chrysostom, we
should say that while the apostles were still alive, the Gospel of Christ was throughout the whole
world, at least by some kind of report. And it is quite miraculous that Christ&#8217;s doctrine should
have grown so much in forty years. And so the Apostle says, in the whole world, that is, by
report; and &#8220;then the end will come,&#8221; that is, the destruction of Jerusalem. But Augustine does
not agree with this interpretation, because even in his own time there were some countries in
which there were yet no churches. So he says the time referred to is the time when the Gospel
will be really preached. Thus the end will come after the Church has become established in all
countries, even though some people are not believers. And this end is not at the time of the
Apostle, but concerns the end of the world. And so when Paul says here, in the whole world, he
is speaking of the future; but he is using the present tense because the outcome is so certain. Yet
we can say that the Gospel is in the whole world by report, although it is not actually established
in all places.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">15. &#8211; Then he commends Christ&#8217;s doctrine because of its fruit in good works: it is bearing fruit:
&#8220;My blossoms became glorious and abundant fruit&#8221; (Sir 24:17); &#8220;He indeed bears fruit, and
yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty&#8221; (Mt 13:23), and it is
growing, that is, in the number of its believers: &#8220;The Lord added to their number day by day those
who were being saved&#8221; (Acts 2:47). This was the effect of a great power, because as among
yourselves, so also among others. From the day you heard, that is, the preaching, and understood,
you accepted it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">16. &#8211; Then he commends its ministry: first, in relation to himself; then in relation to them; and
finally in relation to both. So he says: You have been taught the Gospel, as you learned it from
Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant: &#8220;I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the
prophets&#8221; (Rev 22:9). He is a faithful minister, that is, one who does not seek his own profit:
&#8220;This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1). He is a faithful
minister, that is, a mediator between them and the Apostle, and has made known, i.e., indicated,
to us your love in the Spirit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="13"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Col. 1:9-14</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9 And so, from the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking
that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding, 10 to lead a life worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing
fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. 11 May you be
strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance
and patience with joy, 12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to
share in the inheritance of the saints in light. 13 He has delivered us from the
dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, 14
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">17. &#8211; Above, the Apostle gave the reason for his thanksgiving by mentioning the things for which
he gave thanks; here he states his prayer, showing what he is asking for them. First, he gives the
characteristics of prayer; secondly, he mentions the goods he is asking for (v. 9b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">18. &#8211; Prayer has three characteristics. First, it is timely, thus he says, from the day we heard of
it we began to pray: &#8220;Since I spoke of him, I will still remember him&#8221; (Jer 31:20). Secondly, it
is continuous: we have not ceased to pray for you: &#8220;Far be it from me that I should sin against
the Lord by ceasing to pray for you&#8221; (1 Sam 12:23); &#8220;Without ceasing I mention you always in
my prayers&#8221; (Rom. 1:9). Thirdly, prayer has several elements and is complete: to pray for ...
asking. Praying is lifting our minds up to God; and asking is requesting things. Praying should
come first, so that the one devoutly requesting is heard, just as those who are requesting
something begin by trying to persuade their listener and bend him to their wishes. But we should
begin with devotion and meditation on God and divine things, not in order to bend him, but to
lift ourselves up to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">19. &#8211; He asks for three things. First, for a knowledge of the truth; secondly, that they act in a
virtuous way (v. 10); and thirdly, that they have the endurance to stand up under evil (v. 11b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">20. &#8211; He requests three kinds of knowledge for them. First, a knowledge of what they are to do;
and so he says, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, that is, that you may fully
know the will of God: &#8220;This is the will of God, your sanctification,&#8221; as we read in 1
Thessalonians (4:3). Thus, one who lives in a holy way knows God&#8217;s will; but one who sins does
not know the will of God, because every sinner is ignorant: &#8220;That you may prove what is the
good and acceptable and perfect will of God&#8221; (Rom 12:2). Secondly, he wants them to have a
knowledge of divine things, in all wisdom, which consists in the knowledge of divine things, as
Augustine says: &#8220;Think of the Lord with uprightness&#8221; (Wis 1:1). Thirdly, he wants them to have
an understanding of spiritual things, i.e., not of these earthly material things: &#8220;Now we have
received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is from God,&#8221; as 1 Corinthians (2:12)
says. He appropriately associates wisdom and understanding, because wisdom is weak when
there is no understanding, as Gregory says, and understanding is useless without wisdom: for
wisdom judges and understanding apprehends, and one cannot apprehend without judging, and
vice versa. The Gloss says that the first kind of knowledge is taken in general, the second pertains
to the active life, and the third to the contemplative life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">21. &#8211; Further, knowledge by itself is not enough, because &#8220;Whoever knows what is right to do
and fails to do it, for him it is sin&#8221; (Jas. 4:17). And therefore, it is necessary to act according to
virtue. He touches on this when he says, to lead a life worthy of the Lord, for one lives
unworthily if he does not live as is fitting for a son of God to live: &#8220;As servants of God we
commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships...&#8221; (2 Cor.
6:4); &#8220;As we solemnly forewarned you&#8221; (1 Th 4:6). Secondly, he touches on a correct intention:
fully pleasing: &#8220;There was one who pleased God and was loved by him&#8221; (Wis 4:10). Thirdly, he
brings in the desire to make progress: bearing fruit in every good work, for one should always
try for a further good: &#8220;My blossoms became glorious and abundant fruit&#8221; (Sir 24:17); &#8220;The
return you get is sanctification and its end eternal life&#8221; (Rom 6:22). And after one has borne fruit,
an increase in knowledge follows, and increasing in the knowledge of God; for as a result of
eagerly accomplishing the commands of God, a person is disposed for knowledge: &#8220;I understand
more than the aged, because I keep your precepts&#8221; (Ps 119:100); &#8220;Wisdom will not dwell in a
body enslaved to sin&#8221; (Wis 1:4). He says, increasing in the knowledge of God, and not of the
world: &#8220;She gave him a knowledge of holy things&#8221; (Wis 10:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">22. &#8211; Then he mentions their standing up under evils, for to live a virtuous life it is not enough
just to know and to will; one must also act in spite of opposition: and this cannot be done without
a patient endurance of evils. And so he says, may you be strengthened with all power: &#8220;Rich in
power&#8221; (Sir 44:6). Such power, or virtue, comes from God; and so he says, according to his
glorious might: &#8220;Be strong in the Lord&#8221; (Eph 6:10). He says, glorious might, that is, Christ&#8217;s,
who is the glory of the Father, because to fall into sin is to fall into darkness: &#8220;She is a breath of
the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty&#8221; (Wis 7:25). Then when
he says, for all patience and longsuffering, he prays that they may stand up under adversity. Some
people fail because of the difficulties of their adversities; and they need patience: &#8220;By your
patience you will gain your lives&#8221; (Lk 21:19). Other people fail because their reward is a long
time coming; and so he says, longsuffering, which enables a person to wait for what was
promised: &#8220;It it does not come soon, wait for it; because it will come and not delay&#8221; (Hab 2:3);
&#8220;And thus, with his longsuffering, he obtained what was promised&#8221; (Heb 6:15). Yet, although
some people do avoid these two vices, they do it with sadness; and since this should not be so
he says, with joy: &#8220;Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials&#8221; (Jas. 1:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">23. &#8211; Then when he says, giving thanks to God the Father [Vulgate], he gives thanks for the
favors granted to all of the faithful: first for the gift of grace, and then secondly for the fruit of
grace (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">24. &#8211; And so he says: We pray for you, giving thanks to God, as our Creator, and the Father, by
adopting us, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. Some people
have said that the gifts of grace are given because of a person&#8217;s merit, and that God gives grace
to those who are worthy, and does not give grace to those who are unworthy. But this view is
rejected by the Apostle, because whatever worth and grace we have was given to us by God, and
so also were the effects of grace. And so Paul says, who has qualified us to share in the
inheritance of the saints in light: &#8220;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to claim anything as
coming from us; our sufficiency is from God&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:5). To share in the inheritance [lot] of
the saints in light. All men are good in their very nature; consequently, they somehow partake
of God. But those who are wicked take pleasure in temporal things as their portion: &#8220;This is our
portion and this our lot&#8221; (Wis 2:9), while those who are holy have God himself as their portion:
&#8220;The Lord is my portion&#8221; (Lam 3:24); &#8220;The Lord is my chosen portion&#8221; (Ps 16:5). And so he
says, who has qualified us to share in the lot of the saints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">25. &#8211; He says, in the lot of the saints, because there are two ways of apportioning things:
sometimes it is done by choosing, as when a person selects this portion, and another one that
portion; and sometimes apportionment is by lot: &#8220;The lot puts and end to disputes&#8221; (Pr 18:18).
The saints have their portion not because they chose it: &#8220;You did not choose me, but I chose you&#8221;
(Jn 15:16), but because God chose them. (A lot consists in entrusting something to God&#8217;s
judgment. And there are three types of lot: consultative, divining, and apportioning. The first is
not evil when dealing in temporal matters; the second is useless and evil, and the third is
sometimes allowed in cases of necessity.) The portion of the saints is the possession of the light:
&#8220;He dwells in unapproachable light&#8221; (1 Tim 6.16); &#8220;In his hands he hides the light and commands
it to come again&#8221; (Job 36:32), and from it there follows the effect of grace, i.e., our transference
from darkness to light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">26. &#8211; First, he mentions this transference; and secondly, the way in which men are the slaves of
sin before they receive grace. For since sin is a darkness, men [before receiving grace] are in the
power of darkness, i.e., either of the evil spirits or of sins: &#8220;Against the world rulers of this
present darkness&#8221; (Eph 6:12), &#8220;Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken&#8221; (Is 49:25). He has
transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, i.e., that we might be the kingdom of God: &#8220;My
kingdom is not of this world&#8221; (Jn 18:36). This happens when we are freed from our sins: &#8220;You
have made them a kingdom and priests to our God&#8221; (Rev 5:10). Or literally, we are transferred
to this kingdom so that we may obtain eternal life: &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is at hand&#8221; (Mt 3:2).
And this is what he says: the kingdom of his beloved Son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">27. &#8211; A more literal translation of this phrase would read: the kingdom of the Son of his love. As
Augustine says in a Gloss, &#8220;love&#8221; is sometimes taken to mean the Holy Spirit, who is the love
of the Father and the Son. But if &#8220;love&#8221; were always to mean this Person, then the Son would be
the Son of the Holy Spirit. So at other times &#8220;love&#8221; is understood essentially, to indicate the
divine essence. Thus the phrase, of the Son of his love, can be taken to mean either &#8220;of his
beloved Son,&#8221; or it could mean, &#8220;of the Son of his [the Father&#8217;s] essence.&#8221; But is it true to say
that the Son is the Son of the essence of the Father? I answer that if the possessive case, &#8220;of the
essence&#8221; is taken to indicate the relationship of an efficient cause, it is false; because the essence
[of the Father] does not generate nor is it generated. Sometimes the possessive case indicates the
possession of a form, as when we say a thing is &#8220;of an excellent form,&#8221; that is, it has an excellent
form. And if we understand &#8220;of the essence&#8221; in this way, then the statement is true, that is, the
Son has the essence of the Father: &#8220;The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his
hand&#8221; (Jn 3:35).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">28. &#8211; Then when he says, in whom we have redemption, he shows the way we have been
transferred. For humanity in sin was held down in two ways: first, as a slave: &#8220;Every one who
commits sin is a slave to sin&#8221; (Jn. 8:34), and secondly, as deserving punishment and as turned
away from God: &#8220;Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your
sins have hid his face from you so that he does not hear&#8221; (Is 59:2). But these two things are taken
away by Christ, because, as man, he became a sacrifice for us and redeemed us in his blood; and
so Paul says, in whom we have redemption: &#8220;You were bought with a price&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:20); and
from Christ, as God, we have the forgiveness of sins, because he took away our debt of
punishment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">15 He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation, 16 for in
him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether
thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities&#8212;all things were created
through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold
together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">29. &#8211; After Paul recalled for us the universal and special benefits of grace, he now commends the
Author of this grace, that is, Christ. And he does this, first, in his relation to God; secondly, in
relation to all of creation (15b), and thirdly, in relation to the Church (v. 18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">30. &#8211; As to the first, we should note that God is said to be invisible because he exceeds the
capacity of vision of any created intellect, so that no created intellect, by its natural knowledge,
can attain His essence: &#8220;Behold, God is great, and we know him not&#8221; (Job 36:26); &#8220;He dwells
in unapproachable light&#8221; (1 Tim. 6:16). And therefore, he is seen by the blessed by means of
grace, and not by reason of their natural capacity. Dionysius gives the reason for this: all
knowledge terminates at something which exists, that is, at some nature that participates in the
act of existence [esse]; but God is the very act of existence [ipsum esse], not participating in the
act of existence, but participated in; and thus he is not known. It is of this invisible God that the
Son is the image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">31. &#8211; Let us now see in what way the Son is called the image of God, and why he is said to be
invisible. The notion of an image includes three things. First, an image must be a likeness;
secondly, it must be derived or drawn from the thing of which it is a likeness; and thirdly, it must
be derived with respect to something that pertains to the species or to a sign of the species. For
if two things are alike, but neither is derived from the other, then neither one is the image of the
other; thus one egg is not said to be the image of another. And so something is called an image
because it imitates. Further, if there is a likeness between two things, but not according to species
or a sign of the species, we do not speak of an image. Thus, a man has many accidents, such as
color, size and so on; but they are not the reason for calling something an image of a man. But
if something has the shape or figure of a man, then it can be called an image, because this shape
is a sign of the species. Now the Son is like the Father, and the Father is like the Son. But
because the Son has this likeness from the Father, and not the Father from the Son, we, properly
speaking, say that the Son is the image of the Father, and not conversely: for this likeness is
drawn and derived from the Father. Further, this likeness is according to species, because in
divine matters the Son is somehow, although faintly, represented by our mental word. We have
a mental word when we actually conceive the form of the thing of which we have knowledge;
and then we signify this mental word by an external word. And this mental word we have
conceived is a certain likeness, in our mind, of the thing, and it is like it in species. And so the
Word of God is called the image of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">32. &#8211; As to our second question, we should note that the Arians misunderstood the text: for they
thought about the image of God as they did of the images they made of their ancestors, so they
could see in these images the loved ones no longer with them (just as we make images of the
saints to see in these images those whom we cannot see in reality). And so they said that to be
invisible was unique to the Father, and that the first visible reality was the Son, who manifested
the goodness of the Father. They were saying that the Father was truly invisible, but the Son was
visible, and thus their natures would be different. But the Apostle refutes this when he says: &#8220;He
reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his
word of power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high&#8221; (Heb 1:3). And thus the Son is not only the image of the invisible God, but he
himself is invisible like the Father: He is the image of the invisible God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">33. &#8211; Then when he says, the first-born of all creation, he commends Christ in relation to
creatures. First he does so; and secondly, he amplifies it (v. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">34. &#8211; We should note, about the first point, that the Arians understood this to mean that Christ
is called the first-born because he is the first creature. But this is not the meaning, as will be
clear. So we have to understand two things: how this image is generated, and in what way it is
the first-born of creatures.. In regard to the first, we should note that things generate in various
ways depending on their nature and manner of existence, for men generate in one way, and plants
in another, and so on for other things. But the nature of God is his existence [ipsum esse] and his
act of understanding [intelligere] and so it is necessary that his generating or intellectual
conceiving is the generating or conceiving of his nature. (In us, however, our intellectual
conceiving is not the conceiving of our nature, because our nature is not the same as our act of
understanding). Therefore, since this image is a word and concept of an intellect, it is necessary
to say that it is the offspring of the nature, so that the one receiving the nature from the other is
generated by necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">35. &#8211; Secondly, we have to understand in what way the Son is called the first-born. God does not
know himself and creatures through two different sources; he knows all things in his own
essence, as in the first efficient cause. The Son, however, is the intellectual concept or
representation of God insofar as he knows himself, and as a consequence, every creature.
Therefore, inasmuch as the Son is begotten, he is seen as a word representing every creature, and
he is the principle of every creature. For if he were not begotten in that way, the Word of the
Father would be the first-born of the Father only, and not of creatures: &#8220;I came forth from the
mouth of the Most High, the first-born before every creature&#8221; (Sir 24:5) [Vulgate]. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">36. &#8211; Then when he says, in him all things were created, he explains what he has just said, that
is, that the Son is the first-born because he was generated as the principle of creatures; and this
with respect to three things. First, with respect to the creation of things; in the second place, with
respect to their distinction, in heaven and on earth, and thirdly, with respect to their preservation
in existence, and in him all things hold together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">37. &#8211; He says that the Son is the first-born of every creature because he is generated or begotten
as the principle of every creature. And so he says, for in him all things were created. With respect
to this, we should note that the Platonists affirmed the existence of Ideas, and said that each thing
came to be by participating in an Idea, like the Idea of man, or an Idea of some other kind. Instead
of all these we have one, that is, the Son, the Word of God. For an artisan makes an artifact by
making it participate in the form he has conceived within himself, enveloping it, so to say, with
external matter; for we say that the artisan makes a house through the form of the thing which
he has conceived within himself. This is the way God is said to make all things in his wisdom,
because the wisdom of God is related to his created works just as the art of the builder is to the
house he has made. Now this form and wisdom is the Word; and thus in him all things were
created, as in an exemplar: &#8220;He spoke and they were made&#8221; (Gen 1) , because he created all
things to come into existence in his eternal Word.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">38. &#8211; With respect to the differences among things, we should note that some, like the
Manicheans, were mistaken in thinking that earthly bodies, since they are corruptible, were made
by an evil god, while the heavenly bodies, because they are incorruptible, were made by the good
God, that is, by the Father of Christ. This was an error, because both types of bodies were created
in the same [Word]. And so he says, in heaven and on earth. This difference is based on the
different parts of corporeal nature. &#8220;In the beginning,&#8221; that is, in the Son, &#8220;God created the
heavens and the earth&#8221; (Gen 1:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">39. &#8211; The Platonists also said that God created invisible creatures, that is, the angels, by himself,
but created bodily natures by the angels. But this is refuted here, because Paul says, visible and
invisible. As to the first he says: &#8220;By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word
of God; that from invisible things visible things might be made&#8221; (Heb 11:3). About the second
we read. &#8220;We have seen but few of his works. For the Lord has made all things, and to the godly
he has granted wisdom&#8221; (Sir 43:32-33). This difference in things is based on the nature of created
things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">40. &#8211; The third difference is concerned with the order and degrees found in invisible realities,
when he says, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities. The Platonists were
mistaken in this matter for they said that there are different perfections found in things, and
attributed each of these to its own first principle. And they said there was an order of principles
according to the orders of these perfections. Thus they affirmed a first being, from whom all
things participate in existence; and another principle, distinct from this, a first intellect, from
which all things participate in intelligence, and then another principle, life, from which all things
participate in life. But we do not agree with this, for all the perfections found in things are from
one principle. Thus he says, whether thrones or dominions ..., and so on. As if to say: they do not
depend on an array of principles, but on the one unique Word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">41. &#8211; Why does Paul say in his letter to the Ephesians (1:22) &#8220;He has made him the head over all
the Church&#8221;? For he does not seem to be saying the same thing there as here. I reply that here
Paul is giving a descending list of such beings, because he is showing the procession of creatures
from God; but in Ephesians he gives an ascending list, because he is showing that the Son of
God, as man, is above all creatures. In Ephesians, the principalities are placed under the
authorities (or powers), and the virtues are between the dominions and authorities; but here in
our text, the principalities are placed above the authorities, and between the dominions and the
authorities. This is the way the teaching of Gregory differs from that of Dionysius. For Dionysius
arranges the spiritual beings as they are in Ephesians, because he puts the dominions, the virtues
and authorities in the second hierarchy. But Gregory arranges them as Paul does here, because
he puts the dominions, principalities and authorities in the second hierarchy; and the virtues,
archangels and the angels in the third hierarchy. We should note, as Gregory and Dionysius say,
that the spiritual gifts from which these different orders receive their names are common to all
of them; yet some orders receive their name from certain of these gifts, and others receive their
name from different gifts. The reason for this can be seen from the teachings of the Platonists:
whatever belongs to something belongs to it in one of three ways: essentially, or by participation,
or causally. A thing belongs essentially to another if it belongs to it according to a certain
proportion to its nature; this is the way to be rational belongs to man. A thing belongs by
participation to another if it surpasses the nature of the thing which has it, although the thing
participates to a certain extent in it, although imperfectly; thus man is intellectual by
participation, while to be intellectual, which is superior to being rational, is in the angels
essentially. One thing belongs to another causally if it accrues to it, as artifacts belong to a
person; for they do not exist in him as in matter, but exist in his artistic power. Now a thing is
named only from what belongs to it essentially; thus we do not define man as an intellectual or
artistic being, but as rational. In regard to the gifts present in the angels, those which belong to
the higher angels essentially, belong to the lower ones by participation; and those which belong
to the lower ones essentially, are present in the higher angels causally. Consequently, the higher
angels receive their names from the higher gifts. But the highest thing in a spiritual creature is
that it attain to God and somehow participate in him; and therefore the higher angels receive their
name because they attain God: seraphim, as being fervent or on fire with God; the cherubim, as
knowing God; and the thrones, as having God seated in them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">42. &#8211; For one thing can participate in another in three ways: first, it can receive what is proper
to the nature of what it is participating in; secondly, it can receive a thing insofar as it knows it;
and thirdly, it can somehow serve the power of a thing. For example, a doctor participates in the
art of medicine either because he possesses in himself the art of medicine, or because he has
received a knowledge of the art, or because he serves or devotes himself to the medical art. The
first way of participating is greater than the second, and the second way is greater than the third.
In Sacred Scripture, what is divine is signified by fire: &#8220;The Lord your God is a devouring fire&#8221;
(Deut 4:24). And so the highest order of angels is called the seraphim, as though on fire with God
and having a divine property. The second order is the cherubim, who attain God by knowledge.
And the third are the thrones, who serve or are devoted to his power. The other orders are not
given their names because they attain God, but because of some activity of God. Some angels
direct or command, and these are the dominions. Others accomplish and carry out [what is
commanded] , the principal angels who do this are the principalities: &#8220;Princes went before, joined
with singers&#8221; (Ps 68:27). Among the others who carry out commands, some act over spiritual
creatures, such as the authorities (powers), who restrain the evil spirits. If some act over natural
things, they are called virtues, and these perform miracles. If they act over human beings, they
are called archangels if they are concerned with great matters, and angels if concerned with lesser
things. And so Paul concludes, all things were created through him [per ipsum], as by an efficient
cause, and in him [in Thomas&#8217; text], as in an exemplary cause: &#8220;All things were made through
him, and without him was not anything made that was made&#8221; (Jn 1:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">43. &#8211; Since someone might ask: Are all things eternal? the Apostle, says in answer: No! He is
before all, i.e., that is, before all times and other things: &#8220;The Lord possessed me in the beginning
of his ways, before he made anything from the beginning&#8221; (Prov 8:22). Or, He is before all in
dignity: &#8220;Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord?&#8221; (Ps 89:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">44. &#8211; As relating to the conservation of things he says, and in him all things hold together, that
is, they are conserved. For God is to things as the sun is to the moon, which loses its light when
the sun leaves. And so, if God took his power away from us, all things would immediately cease
to exist: &#8220;Upholding the universe by his word of power&#8221; (Heb 1:3).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">18 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the first-born from
the dead, that in everything he might be pre-eminent. 19 For in him all the fulness
of God was pleased to dwell, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all
things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. 21
And you, who once were estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, 22 he
has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy
and blameless and irreproachable before him, 23 provided that you continue in
the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel which you
heard, which has been preached to every creature under heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">45. &#8211; After the Apostle commended Christ in his relationship to God and to all creatures, he here
commends him in his relationship to the Church: first, in a general way; secondly, in particular,
in reference to the Colossians (v. 21); and thirdly, in reference to himself (v. 23b). In regard to
the first he does two things: first, he mentions Christ&#8217;s relationship to the entire Church; and
secondly, he explains this relationship (v. l8b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">46. &#8211; He says therefore that Christ, the first-born among creatures, is the one in whom we have
our redemption. But because he has been made the head of the Church, two things have to be
explained: first, in what way the Church is a body; and secondly, how Christ is its head. The
Church is called a body because of its likeness to a single human being. This likeness is twofold:
first, in that it has distinct members: &#8220;And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some
prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers&#8221; (Eph 4:11); secondly, because the
members of the Church serve each other in ways that are different: &#8220;The members may have the
same care for one another&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:25); &#8220;Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of
Christ&#8221; (Gal 6:2). Again, just as a body is one because its soul is one, so the Church is one
because the Spirit is one: &#8220;There is one body and one Spirit&#8221; (Eph 4:4); &#8220;Because there is one
bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:17). Next
we have to consider the relationship of the members to the head of the Church, i.e., to Christ. For
Christ is the head of the Church. &#8220;But you, O Lord, are the lifter of my head&#8221; (Ps 3:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">47. &#8211; He explains what it means to be a head, saying, he is the beginning, the first-born from the
dead. The head has three privileges over the other members of the body. First, it is superior in
dignity, because it is a source and a ruler. Secondly, it has the fulness of the senses, which are
all in the head. Thirdly, it is the source of an inflow of sense and movement to the members of
the body. So first, Paul shows how Christ is head because of his dignity; secondly, because of the
fulness of his grace (v. 19); and thirdly, because of an inflow from him (v. 20). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">48. &#8211; The Church exists in two states: the state of grace in the present time, and the state of glory
in the future. But it is the same Church, and Christ is its head in both states, because he is the first
in grace and the first in glory. With respect to the first he says, he is the beginning, the first-born
from the dead, because he is not only first in grace insofar as he is a man, but all men are justified
by faith in Christ: &#8220;By one man&#8217;s obedience many will be made righteous&#8221; (Rom 5:19). So he
says, he is the beginning [principium], that is, the beginning or source of justification and grace
in the entire Church; because even in the Old Testament some were justified by faith in Christ:
&#8220;I am the beginning who am speaking to you&#8221; (Jn 8:25); &#8220;With you is the beginning&#8221; (Ps 110:3)
[Vulgate]. Christ is also the beginning of the state of glory; and so he says, the first-born from
the dead. The reason for this is that the resurrection from the dead is a kind of second birth,
because it restores us to eternal life: &#8220;In the rebirth, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious
throne&#8221; (Mt 19:28); but Christ is the first of all; and thus he is the first-born from the dead, that
is, the first-born of those who are born by the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">49. &#8211; But what about Lazarus (Jn 11)? 1 answer that he and some others did not rise to the above
mentioned immortal life, but to a mortal life; but &#8220;Christ, having risen from the dead, will never
die again&#8221; (Rom 6:9); &#8220;Jesus Christ, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth&#8221;
(Rev 1:5); &#8220;Christ has risen from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep&#8221; (1 Cor.
15:20). And this is so that in everything he might be pre-eminent: pre-eminent in the gifts of
grace, because he is the beginning; and pre-eminent in the gifts of glory, because he is the
first-born: &#8220;In every nation I have had first place&#8221; (Sir 24:10) [Vulgate].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">50. &#8211; Then (v. 19), he shows the dignity of the head with respect to the fulness of all graces. For
some saints had particular graces, but Christ had all graces; and so he says, that in him all the
fulness was pleased to dwell [it seems that Thomas&#8217; version lacked the words &#8220;of God&#8221;]. Each
word has its own force. Pleased indicates that the gifts Christ had as man were not the result of
fate or merits, as Photinus says, but were due to the good pleasure of the divine will taking this
man into a unity of person: &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased&#8221; (Mt 3:17).
He says, all, because some have one gift and others different ones; but [with Christ] &#8220;The Father
had given all things into his hands&#8221; (Jn 13:3). He says, fulness, because one can have a gift
without having the fulness of it or of its power, because perhaps one lacks something unwillingly.
But John says that Christ was &#8220;full of grace and truth&#8221; (Jn 1:14), &#8220;My abode is in the fulness of
the saints&#8221; (Sir 24:16). He says to dwell, because some received the use of a grace for only a
time; thus the spirit of prophecy was not always possessed by the prophets, but it is continuously
present in Christ, because he always has control over this fulness to use it as he wishes: &#8220;He on
whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit&#8221; as we
read in John (1:33). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">51. &#8211; Then when he says, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, he shows that Christ
is the head of the Church because of an inflow from him. And this is the third characteristic of
a head. First, he shows the inflow of grace; and secondly, he explains it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">52. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that it pleased God not only that this fulness exist in Christ, but that
it also flow from Christ to us; and so he says, and through him to reconcile to himself all things:
&#8220;God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">53. &#8211; He mentions the nature of this reconciliation and how all things are reconciled. Now there
are two things to be considered in a reconciliation. First, the matters in which the reconciled
persons agree. For people at odds have conflicting wills, but when they have been reconciled they
agree in some things; and so wills that were before in conflict are made to harmonize in Christ.
For example, the wills of men, of God and of the angels. The will of men, because Christ is a
man; and the will of God, because Christ is God. There was also conflict between the Jews, who
wanted the law, and the Gentiles, who did not want the law. But Christ created harmony between
the two, because he was from the Jews, and he freed us from the legal observances. This harmony
was accomplished by the blood of his cross. The cause of discord between God and men was sin;
the discord between the Jews and the Gentiles was caused by the law. Now Christ destroyed sin
by his cross and fulfilled the law; and thus he took away the causes of discord: &#8220;You have come
to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem&#8221; (Heb 12:22). Thus we
are reconciled and all things are set at peace, whether on earth, that is, Jews and Gentiles, or in
heaven, that is, the angels and God. And so when Christ was born the angels sang: &#8220;Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace among men&#8221; (Lk 2:14). Again, Christ said at his resurrection:
&#8220;Peace be with you&#8221; (Jn 20:19); &#8220;For he is our peace, who has made us both one&#8221; (Eph 2:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">54. &#8211; Then (v. 21), Christ is commended because of the gifts he gave them. First, Paul recalls
their past condition; secondly, Christ&#8217;s gift (v. 22); and thirdly, what they have to do now (v. 23).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">55. &#8211; Their past condition had three evils: in their intellect, they were ignorant; in their affections,
they were enemies of justice; and in their actions, they committed many sins. In regard to the first
he says, estranged; in regard to the second, hostile in mind, according to the reading of one
version. This shows that there was a defect in that wisdom that the Jews proclaimed about the
one God: &#8220;Men loved darkness rather than light&#8221; (Jn 3:19). But were the Jewish people bound
to the law of Moses? Yes they were, so far as it concerned the worship of the one God. Or, we
could say the Jews were estranged in mind, i.e., by choice, maliciously contradicting God: &#8220;They
turned aside from following him&#8221; (Job 34:27). As to the third evil of their past condition he says,
doing evil deeds: &#8220;Their deeds were evil,&#8221; as we read in John (3:19). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">56. &#8211; Then when he says, he has now reconciled, he mentions the benefits coming from Christ.
The first of these is reconciliation in his body; and so he says, he has now reconciled in his body
of flesh. He says, his body of flesh, not because his body and his flesh are not the same, but to
show that Christ took a real body: &#8220;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us&#8221; (Jn 1:14).
A body of flesh, that is, a mortal body: &#8220;God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
and of sin, has condemned sin in the flesh&#8221; (Rom 8:3). The second benefit coming from Christ
is holiness; thus he says, in order to present you holy: &#8220;So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in
order to sanctify the people through his own blood&#8221; (Heb 13.12). The third benefit is their
cleansing from sin; and as to this he says, and blameless: &#8220;The blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purifies your conscience from dead works&#8221;
(Heb 9:14). Looking to the future he says, irreproachable: &#8220;Be zealous to be found by him
without spot or blemish and at peace&#8221; (2 Pet 3:14). And he adds, before him: &#8220;Man sees things
that appear, but the Lord beholds the heart&#8221; (1 Kg. 16:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">57. &#8211; What God requires of us is that we be firm in faith and hope. And so Paul continues,
provided that you continue in the faith, stable. For faith is a foundation; if it is firm the entire
structure of the Church is firm. And steadfast in hope, not weakening themselves from within;
not shifting by allowing others to shake that hope. This hope, I say, is the hope of the gospel, that
is, the hope that the Gospel gives for the good things of the kingdom of heaven: &#8220;Repent, for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand&#8221; (Mt 4:17). And there is no excuse, because the Gospel has been
preached; and he uses the past tense here instead of the future tense because this future event is
so certain. The Gospel has been preached, by the apostles that is, to every creature under heaven,
that is, to every new creature, that is, to the faithful, for whom it had been prepared.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="16"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-6</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Col. 1:23b-29</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">23b And of which 1, Paul, became a minister. 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings
for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ&#8217;s afflictions
for the sake of his body, that is, the church, 25 of which I became a minister
according to the divine office which was given to me for you, to make the word
of God fully known, 26 the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now
made manifest to his saints. 27 To them God chose to make known how great
among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in
you, the hope of glory. 28 Him we proclaim, warning every man and teaching
every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man mature in Christ. 29 For
this I toil, striving with all the energy which he mightily inspires within me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">58. &#8211; After Paul commended Christ in relation to God, to all creation, to the entire Church, and
to the Colossians themselves, he now commends him in relation to himself, showing that he is
Christ&#8217;s minister. First, he mentions his ministry; secondly, he shows his faithfulness in it; and
thirdly, its greatness (v. 25).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">59. &#8211; He says: I say that the Gospel has been preached to all, the Gospel of which 1, Paul, became
a minister; to preach it, not on my own authority, but only as a minister: &#8220;This is how one should
regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">60. &#8211; He is a faithful minister. This is obvious, because he does not run away from the dangers
involved in his preaching. First, he shows his attitude toward his sufferings; secondly, the fruit
of his suffering (v. 24b). His attitude was one of joy, because Now I rejoice in my sufferings for
your sake, that is, for your benefit: &#8220;If we are afflicted it is for your comfort and salvation; and
if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the
same sufferings that we suffer&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:6). He also rejoices because of the joy of eternal life
which he expects from them, and which is the fruit of his ministry: &#8220;Count it all joy, my brethren,
when you meet various trials, for you know that the testimony of your faith produces
steadfastness&#8221; (Jas 1:2), &#8220;Even if I am to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of
your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all&#8221; (Phil 2:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">61. &#8211; And along with the above there is the fruit that in my flesh I complete what is lacking in
Christ&#8217;s afflictions. At first glance these words can be misunderstood to mean that the passion
of Christ was not sufficient for our redemption, and that the sufferings of the saints were added
to complete it. But this is heretical, because the blood of Christ is sufficient to redeem many
worlds: &#8220;He is the expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole
world&#8221; (1 Jn 2:2). Rather, we should understand that Christ and the Church are one mystical
person, whose head is Christ, and whose body is all the just, for every just person is a member
of this head: &#8220;individually members&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:27). Now God in his predestination has arranged
how much merit will exist throughout the entire Church, both in the head and in the members,
just as he has predestined the number of the elect. And among these merits, the sufferings of the
holy martyrs occupy a prominent place. For while the merits of Christ, the head, are infinite, each
saint displays some merits in a limited degree. This is why he says, I complete what is lacking
in Christ&#8217;s afflictions, that is, what is lacking in the afflictions of the whole Church, of which
Christ is the head. I complete, that is, I add my own amount; and I do this in my flesh, that is, it
is I myself who am suffering. Or, we could say that Paul was completing the sufferings that were
lacking in his own flesh. for what was lacking was that, just as Christ had suffered in his own
body, so he should also suffer in Paul, his member, and in similar ways in others. And Paul does
this for the sake of his body, which is the Church that was to be redeemed by Christ: &#8220;That he
might present the Church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle&#8221; (Eph 5:27). In the same
way all the saints suffer for the Church, which receives strength from their example. The Gloss
says that &#8220;afflictions are still lacking, because the treasure house of the Church&#8217;s merits is not
full, and it will not be full until the end of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">62. &#8211; Then when he says, of which I became a minister, he shows the greatness of his ministry
in three ways: first, from its origin, in the second place, from the end to which it is directed (v.
25b); and thirdly, from its purpose (v. 28).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">63. &#8211; But someone could say: &#8220;Is his a great ministry?&#8221; He answers: Yes, because I became a
minister because it was given to me according to the divine office. This can be explained in two
ways. First in an active sense, and then the meaning is that I became a minister so that I could
dispense divine things to you, faithfully passing them on; and this power has been given to me.
Secondly, it can be explained in a passive sense, and then the meaning is that Paul became a
minister in so far as he was appointed by God. &#8220;And his gifts were that some should be apostles,
some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers&#8221; (Eph 4:11); &#8220;Set apart for me
Barnabas and Paul for the work to which I have called them&#8221; (Acts 13:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">64. &#8211; What is the end of his ministry? Certainly, not money, or his own glory. Rather, he has
received it for a great purpose, that is, to make the word of God fully known. First, he shows the
greatness of that for which he has received this ministry; secondly, he shows what this is, that is,
that it is Christ. He shows its greatness because it has been widely proclaimed, both in an obscure
form and openly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">65. &#8211; The ministry he received was to convert the Gentiles; thus, to make fully known the word,
that is, the eternal dispensation of God. In other words, by my preaching I am to show that the
word of God has been fulfilled, that is, God&#8217;s dispensation and plan and promise concerning the
incarnation of the Word of God. Or, I am to show by my preaching the eternal dispensation of
God in which he arranged that the Gentiles were to be converted by Christ to a faith in the true
God. And this had to be accomplished: &#8220;Does he say and not do? Does he speak and not do what
he said?&#8221; (Num. 23:19), &#8220;My word that goes forth from my mouth shall not return to me empty,
but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and prosper in the thing for which I sent it,&#8221; as we
read in Isaiah (55:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">66. &#8211; But God arranged that this be accomplished by Paul&#8217;s ministry, and so Paul says, to make
fully known this mystery (it is called a mystery insofar as it is hidden), because this mystery
which has been hidden is this word: &#8220;I have a secret, I have a secret&#8221; (Is 24:16) [Vulgate]. This
mystery was hidden for ages, that is, from the beginning of the ages, and it was hidden from all
the generations of men, who were unable to know this: &#8220;the plan of the mystery hidden for ages
in God&#8221; (Eph 3:9). For even though the early philosophers seem to have said something about
Christ&#8217;s divinity, either as being his own or appropriated (as Augustine found in the works of
Plato, such as that &#8220;in the beginning was the Word,&#8221; and things like that), yet none could know
that the Word was made flesh. But you ask if this was not known by the prophets? I reply that
it was, insofar as it pertained to the Gospel; but it was not known as explicitly as the apostles
knew it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">67. &#8211; Next, he deals with the revelation of this mystery. First, he shows to whom it was revealed;
secondly, why it was revealed to them (v. 27).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">68. &#8211; He says that this mystery is now made manifest, that is, in this time of grace: &#8220;Behold now
is the acceptable time, now is the day of salvation&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:2). This is the knowledge of the
saints: &#8220;She gave him knowledge of holy things&#8221; (Wis 10:10); &#8220;He showed his friend that it
belongs to him, and that he can approach it&#8221; (Job 36:33) [Vulgate].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">69. &#8211; It was revealed to his saints not because of their own merits, but because of God&#8217;s good
pleasure; thus Paul says, to them God chose to make known the riches of the glory of this
mystery: &#8220;All that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose
me, but I chose you&#8221; (Jn 15:15); &#8220;Yea, Father, for such was thy gracious will&#8221; (Mt 11:26). To
make known the riches of the glory of this mystery, because by the fact that such things had been
hidden, God now appears superabundantly glorious. For God was formerly known in Judea, but
through this mystery of the conversion of the Gentiles the glory of God is made known to the
entire world: as we read in John (17:4), &#8220;1 glorified thee on earth.&#8221; And this is to be done among
the Gentiles, that is, it is to be accomplished among them: &#8220;Let us rejoice in our hope of sharing
the glory of God&#8221; (Rom 5:2); &#8220;O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!&#8221;
(Rom 11:33). This mystery, which is Christ, i.e., which we obtain through Christ, is the hope of
glory, which had formerly been promised only to the Jews: &#8220;The believers from among the
circumcised were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the
Gentiles&#8221; (Acts 10:45); &#8220;Justified by faith, let us have peace toward God; and let us glory in the
hope of the glory of the sons of God&#8221; (Rom 5:1-2); &#8220;The root of Jesse, who stands as an ensign
of the people, will be called on by the Gentiles&#8221; (Is 11:10). So far Paul has indicated the origin
and end of his ministry. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">70. &#8211; Now he mentions its function. In regard to this he does three things. First, he indicates its
function; secondly, its fruit (v. 28b), and in the third place, the help he was given (v. 29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">71. &#8211; Its function is to announce Christ; and he shows this function and the method he used:
&#8220;Announce his ways among the Gentiles&#8221; (Ps 9:11); &#8220;That which we have seen and heard we
proclaim also to you&#8221; (1 Jn 1:1). He states his method when he says, warning every man; this is
a complete proclamation, because it is to every person, and not just the Jewish people: &#8220;Teach
all nations&#8221; (Mt 28:19). His method is to teach the truth and to refute what is false, and so he
says, warning every man, or unbeliever, in this life: &#8220;The weapons of our warfare are not worldly
but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every proud obstacle
to the knowledge of God&#8221; (2 Cor. 10:4); and it also consists in teaching every man in all wisdom,
which is the knowledge of God: &#8220;To know you is complete righteousness, and to know your
power is the root of immortality&#8221; (Wis 15:3); &#8220;Among the mature we do impart wisdom&#8221; (1 Cor.
2:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">72. &#8211; The fruit of this in this life is that men are brought to perfection; and so he says, that we
may present every man, that is, of any condition, mature, not in the law, but in Christ. &#8220;You,
therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect&#8221; (Mt 5:48). But is everyone bound
to perfection? No, but it should be the goal of the preacher. Now the perfection of charity is of
two kinds. One is from a necessity of precept, that is, that one not allow into his heart anything
opposed to God: &#8220;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your mind&#8221; (Mt 22:37). The other perfection of charity is from a necessity of
counsel, which is that one give up even those things that are lawful; and this kind of perfection
goes beyond what is required. But for this Paul had God&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">73. &#8211; And so he says, For this I toil, striving against unbelievers and sinners: &#8220;Take your share
of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus&#8221; (2 Tim 2:3); &#8220;I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the race, I have kept the faith&#8221; (2 Tim 4.7). And Paul does this with all the energy, &#8220;the
grace of God is with me&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10), which he inspires within me, because God does this in
me mightily, i.e., that is, by giving me the might or power : &#8220;Stay in the city until you are clothed
with power from on high,&#8221; as we read in Luke (24:49).</p>

the knowledge of God&#8217;s mystery, of Christ, 3 in whom are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge. 4 I say this in order that no one may delude you with
beguiling speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">74. &#8211; Above, Paul commended the condition of those who believe, that is, their state of grace,
and its Author, Christ; here he protects them from what is opposed to this state. First, from
teachings that destroy it; and secondly, from evil habits (ch. 3). In regard to the first he does two
things. First, he shows his concern over their state, and secondly, he warns them against evil
teachings (v. 4). The first part is again divided. First, he mentions his concern; secondly, the
persons about whom he is concerned (v. 1b); and thirdly, the matter which concerns him (v. 2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">75. &#8211; Paul says, I want you to know what concern I have [Vulgate], that is, how great it is; and
this is a mark of a good prelate: &#8220;to govern others with concern&#8221; (Rom 12:8); &#8220;And in that region
there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night&#8221; (Lk 2:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">76. &#8211; His concern is not only for those whom he converted and who were with him, but also for
others. And so he says, for you, whom I have not seen in person, but in my mind&#8217;s eye. And his
concern is also for all who have not seen my face. In fact, Paul cared about the whole world: &#8220;For
upon his long robe the whole world was depicted&#8221; (Wis 18:24); &#8220;And, apart from other things,
there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all of the churches&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:28). But
about whom was Paul most concerned? I answer that in a certain sense he was most concerned
about those whom he could not see, because he did not know what was happening to them. But
he was not concerned more about them in an absolute sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">77. &#8211; Then when he says, that their hearts might be consoled, having been instructed in love, and
in all the riches of a full understanding, so as to know the mystery of God, the Father, and of
Jesus Christ [Vulgate], he shows what he is concerned about, that is, their consolation. First, he
mentions this; and secondly, he states how it can be brought about, instructed in love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">78. &#8211; Paul says, that their hearts might be consoled, that is, that by means of me they might have
spiritual consolation. Such consolation is produced by what is good, for when one is sad over
something, it is a source of joy to be consoled by something equally good. Now there are two
things that console us: meditation on wisdom: &#8220;She [that is, wisdom] would give me
encouragement in cares and grief&#8221; (Wis 8:9), and prayer: &#8220;Is any one of you sad? Let him pray&#8221;
(Jas. 5:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">79. &#8211; Then when he says, having been instructed in love, he mentions their instruction in wisdom.
There are two versions of this passage. First, the one we have here. Secondly, the one found in
the Gloss: &#8220;that the hearts of those instructed in love might be consoled ...&#8221; so that they might
know &#8220;the mystery of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ.&#8221; But the meaning is the same. When
one is instructed in wisdom, he is consoled against temporal evils. But here a person should be
instructed about the way; and so Paul says, in love, which is the way to God: &#8220;I will show you
a still more excellent way. If I should speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not
love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:1). Having been instructed in love, that
is, in the love with which God loves us, and in the love with which we love him; for we are
consoled by each of these loves. We are consoled because God loves us: &#8220;It is no longer I who
live, but Christ who lives in me ... who loved me and gave himself for me&#8221; (Gal 2:20); &#8220;Rich in
mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our
trespasses, he made us alive together with Christ&#8221; (Eph 2:4). And we are also consoled because
we love God, for it is consoling to a friend of God to endure evils for his sake: &#8220;If any evil
happen to me because of him, I will bear it&#8221; (Sir 22:311) [Vulgate].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">80. &#8211; And Paul continues, and in all the riches, that is, to the extent of their capacity. Our intellect
is in potency to know things, while the intellect of the angel was filled at its creation with a
knowledge of understandable things. And so our human intellect must acquire its knowledge; and
it does this either by study (and this is insufficient, because a thing can never be known so well
so that it fulfills the capacity of our intellect); or it acquires its knowledge by a divine revelation
and as a gift from God: and this is sufficient. &#8220;She [wisdom] will feed him with the bread of
understanding, and give him the water of wisdom to drink&#8221; (Sir 15:3). And so he says, of a full
understanding, that is, of an understanding in abundance: &#8220;What is richer than wisdom?&#8221; (Wis
8:5); &#8220;The riches of salvation are wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (Is 33:6). In short, they are to be
instructed with such an abundance of divine wisdom that it fulfills the capacity of their intellect.
We will have this abundance of divine wisdom by knowing God; and so Paul says, so as to know
the mystery of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, that is, to know the truth of this mystery which
had been hidden, which is that God is the Father of Jesus Christ. Or, we could say, to know the
mystery of God the Father, which mystery is Christ. And so Matthew says about the apostles:
&#8220;Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes&#8221; (Mt
11:25). Or, we will have this abundance of the divine wisdom by our knowledge of the eternal
generation and of the incarnation of Christ: &#8220;To fix one&#8217;s thought on her [wisdom] is perfect
understanding&#8221; (Wis 6:15). As Augustine says, &#8220;Happy are those who know you, and unhappy
those who do not.&#8221; It is by knowing God that man has all fullness: &#8220;This is eternal life, that they
know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,&#8221; as we read in John (17:4). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">81. &#8211; But is our intellect filled by knowing Christ? I say that it is because in him are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge. God has a knowledge of all things, and this knowledge is
called a treasure: &#8220;It is an unfailing treasure for men; those who get it obtain friendship with
God&#8221; (Wis 7:14). Now a treasure is a collection of riches; they are not called a treasure when
scattered about, but only when collected in one place. &#8220;God has poured out his wisdom upon all
his works&#8221; (Sir 1:10) [Vulgate]; from this point of view his wisdom does not have the nature of
a treasure. But his wisdom is a treasure when the ideas behind all his works are considered
collected together, that is, in the divine wisdom. And all such treasures are in Christ. Wisdom
is the knowledge of divine things, and science [scientia] is the knowledge of created things. Now
whatever can be known about God, which pertains to wisdom, God knows in himself, and
exhaustively. And likewise, whatever can be known about created things, God knows in himself,
and in an super-eminent way. Now whatever is in the wisdom of God is in his single Word,
because he knows all things by one simple act of his intellect, for in God knowledge is neither
in potency nor in a habitual state. And thus in this Word are all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge [sapientia et scientia].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">82. &#8211; He adds that these treasures are hid, because there are two reasons why something might
be hidden from me: either because my intellect is weak, or because the thing is somehow
covered. Thus, a person may not see a candle either because he is blind, or because the candle
has been covered. And so, in the Word of God there are all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge, but they are hid from us because our eyes are not clear but bleary: &#8220;A little light is
in you&#8221; (Jn 12:35); and they are hid because they are covered with two veils: the veil of creatures,
because at this time our intellect cannot come to this knowledge except through the likeness of
creatures: &#8220;Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power
and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made&#8221; (Rom 1:20); and the veil
of the flesh: &#8220;The Word became flesh&#8221; (Jn 1:14). And even if we do know something about God,
yet we do not see all: &#8220;Truly, you are a God who hides yourself&#8221; (Is 45:15); &#8220;Open your treasure
for him&#8221; (Num. 20:6). Let us suppose that a person has a candle that is covered; he would not
look then for another light, but wait for the light he has to become uncovered. And in the same
way we do not have to look for wisdom anywhere but in Christ: &#8220;For I decided to know nothing
among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:2). And we read in 1 John (3:2):
&#8220;When he appears,&#8221; that is, is revealed, &#8220;we shall be like him,&#8221; that is, knowing all things. In
other words, if I had a book in which all knowledge was contained, I would seek to know only
that book; similarly, it is not necessary for us to seek any further than Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">83. &#8211; Then (v. 4), he teaches and warns them about destructive doctrines. For they were being
misled by certain philosophers in matters against the faith, and by heretics who taught that the
ceremonies of the law had to be observed. First, he teaches them in opposition to the
philosophers; and secondly, in opposition to the Judaizers (v. 11). In worldly knowledge there
are two things: a knowledge of the spoken language, and a knowledge of things themselves. And
so they could be deceived in two ways. Thus he first warns them against those philosophers who
were deceiving them by their ability to speak well; and secondly, against those who were
misleading them about the knowledge of things, when he says, &#8220;See to it that no one makes a
prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit&#8221; (2:8). First, he mentions this deception; and
secondly, the reason for it (v. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">84. &#8211; Thus he says: I say that in Christ there is all knowledge. And I say this so that you will not
be deceived in seeking for knowledge from anywhere else. And he says, I say this in order that
no one, that is, neither Demosthenes or Cicero, may delude you with beguiling speech. &#8220;You will
see no more the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech which you cannot comprehend,
stammering in a tongue which you cannot understand&#8221; (Is 33:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">85. &#8211; But is it a sin to use beautiful language? I answer that it is not, because even saintly men,
like Ambrose, Jerome, and Pope Leo, speak with more eloquence than the orators of this world.
For if one can use fine language to persuade those who are evil, then it can be used much more
to convince those who are good.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5 For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your
good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ. 6 As therefore you received
Christ Jesus the Lord, so live in him, 7 rooted and built up in him and established
in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. 8 See to it that
no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human
tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to
Christ. 9 For in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily, 10 and you have
come to fulness of life in him, who is the head of all rule and authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">86. &#8211; Above, he warned them against falling away from the faith as a result of some deceptive
language; here he gives the reason for this advice, which is based on the good things they have
and should not destroy, but allow to grow. First, he calls to mind the goods which they have; and
secondly, he shows how these should grow within them (v. 6). In regard to the first, he does two
things. First, he shows how he happens to know about the good things they have; secondly, he
mentions what these goods are (v. 5b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">87. &#8211; Paul says, For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing. He is here
saying, in effect, that although I have not preached to you, nor do I see with my own eyes what
you have accomplished, yet I am with you in spirit through my love, rejoicing in your blessings:
&#8220;For though absent in body I am present in spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 5:3); &#8220;A wise son makes a glad father&#8221;
(Pr 10:1). And this because it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit; and so he says, yet I am
with you in spirit. &#8220;Did I not go with you in spirit when the man turned from his chariot to meet
you?&#8221; (2 Kg. 5:26).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">88. &#8211; Rejoicing, I say, because I see your good order, that is, your well-ordered way of life: &#8220;All
things should be done decently and in order&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:40); &#8220;The stars remaining in their order
and courses fought against Sisera&#8221; (Jg 5:20). And rejoicing in the firmness of your faith in Christ:
&#8220;God&#8217;s firm foundation stands&#8217; (2 Tim 2:19). And this in Christ: &#8220;That Christ may dwell in your
hearts through faith, rooted and founded in love&#8221; (Eph 3:17); &#8220;In whom the whole structure is
joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord&#8221; (Eph 2:21). The goodness of this
temple consists in its firm foundation, which is faith, and in a proper superstructure; and that is
why he mentioned these two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">89. &#8211; Then (v. 6), he urges them to protect these goods: first, by advancing in them; secondly, by
their perseverance; and thirdly, by giving thanks. So he says, As therefore you received Christ
Jesus, not in a distorted way, so live in him. &#8220;Hold fast to what is good,&#8221; as we read in Romans
(12:9). Sometimes the Church is compared to a spiritual building: &#8220;God&#8217;s temple is holy, and that
temple you are&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:17). At other times it is compared to a tree, because it produces fruit.
Now the foundation of a building is related to the building as the roots of a tree are related to the
tree, because the foundation and roots are the source of strength; and this source is Christ. &#8220;In
that day the root of Jesse shall stand as an ensign to the peoples&#8221; (Is. 11:10); &#8220;For no other
foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:11). So Paul
uses the expression, rooted, like good branches, and built up in him and established, like good
stones. And they will be like this if they persevere in the faith. &#8220;Your adversary, the devil, prowls
around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour&#8221; (1 Pet. 5:8); and the text continues:
&#8220;Resist him, firm in your faith.&#8221; They are to live in Christ just as you were taught, that is, in the
true faith: &#8220;If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him
be accursed&#8221; (Gal 1:9). Abounding in thanksgiving, giving may thanks: as we read in 1
Thessalonians (5:18), &#8220;Giving thanks in all circumstances&#8221;; &#8220;Having been saved by God out of
grave dangers, we give him great thanks&#8221; (2 Macc 1:11) .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">90. &#8211; Then (v. 8), he warns them not to be deceived by an empty wisdom. First, we see his
warning; and secondly, the reason for it (v. 9). In regard to the first, he first teaches them to avoid
whatever can deceive them; and secondly, the source of this deception (v. 8b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">91. &#8211; A person can be deceived by worldly wisdom in two ways, that is, sometimes by the real
principles of philosophy, and sometimes by fallacious arguments. And Paul teaches them to
beware of both: See to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy, that is, by philosophical
teachings: &#8220;Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray&#8221; (Is 47:10). For there are many who
have turned from the faith after having been deceived by philosophy: &#8220;Man has become foolish
in his knowledge&#8221; (Jer. 10:14). As regards to the second way to be deceived he says, and empty
deceit, which is based on the way words are used: &#8220;Let no one deceive you with empty words,&#8221;
as is said in Ephesians (5:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">92. &#8211; But how are they being deceived? One who deceives another must have something which
seems reasonable, and something which is not really so. So first Paul shows the basis of this
seeming reasonableness. It is based on two things, the first being the authority of the
philosophers. And about this he says, according to human tradition, that is, according to what is
handed down by some, basing themselves on their own judgment: &#8220;The Lord knows the thoughts
of man, that they are but a breath&#8221; (Ps 94:11). The second source of an apparent reasonableness
are the contrivances of reason, that is, when a person wishes to measure or judge about the things
of faith according to the principles of things, and not by divine wisdom. And many are deceived
in this way. And so Paul says, they should not be deceived by those judging according to the
elements of the universe, and not according to Christ: &#8220;They were unable from the good things
that are seen to know him who exists&#8221; (Wis 13:1). Now the higher a cause is, the more superior
is its effect. And so those who wish to investigate certain effects in terms of causes that are
inferior are deceived. For example, if one were to consider the movement of water in terms of
the power of water, he would not be able to know the cause of the tides of the sea; to do this he
would have to consider water in terms of the power of the moon. Thus, those people are even
more deceived who consider the proper effects of God in terms of the elements of the world. And
this is the reason for the seeming plausibility of what they say.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[93. &#8211;] 94. &#8211; Or, we could say that according to the elements of the universe means, by measuring
the truth of faith according to the truth of creatures. Or perhaps Paul said this referring to the
idolaters who were worshiping idols and saying that Jupiter was the heavens. Or, Paul was
referring to the Jewish people, and then the text is understood this way: by philosophy, by the
reasoning of those who were trying to convince them to observe the ceremonies of the law, and
these, according to the elements of the universe or world, that is, according to the bodily
observances: &#8220;We were slaves to the elements of the world&#8221; (Gal 4:3). But our first explanation
is better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">95. &#8211; Then when he says, for in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily, he gives the reason
for what he has just stated, saying that whatever is not according to Christ should be rejected. But
is Christ so good that all things should be rejected for him? He answers that he is, and shows it
in three ways: first, by considering his divinity; secondly, by his relationship to those who believe
(v. 10a); and thirdly, by his relationship to the angels (v. 10b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">96. &#8211; So he says: Whatever is contrary to Christ must be rejected, because he is God. Thus we
must prefer him to everything else, for in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily. Now God
is in all things. He is in some things because they participate in a likeness to his goodness, as a
stone and things like that. Such things are not God, but they have in themselves something of
God; not his substance, but a likeness of his goodness. Consequently, the fulness of divinity does
not dwell in them, because he is not there according to his substance. Again, he is in holy minds
by an activity, minds which attain God by love and knowledge; and thus God is in them by grace,
not bodily, but according to the effect of grace. And he is not there in his fulness, but only by
some limited effects. But God is present in Christ bodily; and this is explained in three ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">97. &#8211; A body is distinguished from its shadow: &#8220;These are only a shadow of what is to come; but
the substance belongs to Christ&#8221; (Heb 2:17). And so God can indwell in two ways, either as a
shadow or bodily, that is, really. The first way is the way he dwelt in the Old Law, but in Christ
he dwells bodily, that is, really and truly. This passage is explained in a second way by saying
that God dwells in the other saints only with respect to their souls, and not in their bodies: &#8220;For
I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh&#8221; (Rom 7:18). But the divinity
dwells in Christ bodily, because the indwelling of God in the saints is by an activity, that is, by
love and knowledge, which are actions of a rational mind alone, but God dwells in Christ by
assuming a man into the unity of his person. And thus whatever relates to this man is indwelt by
God; and thus his flesh and mind are indwelt because both are united to the Word: &#8220;And the
Word became flesh&#8221; (Jn 1:14). The third explanation of this passage is as follows: God is in
things in three ways. One way is common, that is, by his power, presence and essence. He is
present in another way in the saints, that is, by grace. The third way is found only in Christ, and
he is present here by union. Now a body has three dimensions, and the fulness of the divinity
superabounds in Christ in these ways. And so the deity is said to be in him bodily. The fulness
of the divinity is in Christ, as it were, by length, because it extends to all things; it is in him by
breadth, that is, in its charity, and it is in him in its depth, that is, in its incomprehensibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">98. &#8211; Nestorius was mistaken on this point: he said that this union was brought about entirely by
an indwelling, the Word dwelling in the flesh. But the Apostle does not agree with this, for he
says in Philippians (2:7): &#8220;He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant&#8221; Now when one
dwells in a man he does not empty himself; one empties oneself by becoming man. And so Paul
continues, &#8220;being born in the likeness of man.&#8221; And so Christ is indwelt, but not in the sense that
the one indwelling and the one dwelt in are distinct, but in the sense that Christ is both man and
God, in whom dwells the fulness of the deity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">99. &#8211; Then when he says, and you have come to fulness in him, he shows the same thing by
relating Christ to others. He is saying, in effect: You have received all things: &#8220;From his fulness
have we all received&#8221; (Jn 1:16). We should note that the Platonists teach that all divine gifts
come to men by the mediation of the separated substances; and this is true even according to
Dionysius. But this is something special, that we receive divine gifts immediately from him who
is the fulness of the angels: &#8220;The only Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him
known&#8221; (Jn 1:18); &#8220;It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who
heard him&#8221; (Heb 2:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">100. &#8211; And so Paul continues, who is the head of all rule and authority [or, &#8220;principality and
power,&#8221; two orders of angels], insofar as he is their King and Lord, not by a likeness of nature,
because that is the way he is the head of man. And Paul mentions those orders [of angels] which
seem to have a certain preeminence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="23"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">2-3</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11 In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands,
by putting off the body of flesh in the circumcision of Christ; 12 and you were
buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith
in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. 13 And you, who were
dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together
with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, 14 having canceled the bond
which stood against us with its legal demands; this he set aside, nailing it to the
cross. 15 He disarmed the principalities and powers and made a public example
of them, triumphing over them in him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">101. &#8211; Above, Paul warned the faithful against the deceptions of the worldly philosophers; here
he instructs and warns them against those heretics who wanted to drag them into the observances
of the law. First, he instructs them to avoid such persons; secondly, he rejects the false
enticements they used (v. 18). In regard to the first, he does two things: first, he shows that the
observances of the law were completed in Christ; and secondly, he rejects these observances,
showing that they are not bound to follow them (v. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">102. &#8211; Among the observances of the law, the first was circumcision. By this, the Jews professed
their observance of the Old Law, just as we profess our observance of the New Law by baptism:
&#8220;I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound to keep the whole law&#8221;
(Gal 5:3). So Paul says that the faithful have been circumcised with a certain spiritual
circumcision, from which it follows that the other has ceased. First, he shows what kind of
circumcision they have received; and secondly, how it was received. Finally, he tells why they
were circumcised in this way (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">103. &#8211; In regard to the first, we should note that there are two kinds of circumcision, bodily and
spiritual. We have been circumcised by Christ with a spiritual circumcision, and not by the bodily
kind. So first Paul eliminates such a bodily circumcision, and then explains about this spiritual
circumcision. Paul continues: In him, that is, in Christ, you were circumcised with a circumcision
made without hands: &#8220;For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision
something external and physical. He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a
matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal&#8221; (Rom 2:28).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">104. &#8211; By putting off the body of flesh. This can be understood in two ways. In the first way Paul
says that you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body
of flesh, that is, by putting off the corruption of the flesh, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians (15:50):
&#8220;Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the
imperishable.&#8221; He is saying in effect: You have been circumcised because you no longer have
the vices of the flesh: &#8220;You have put off the old nature with its practices&#8221; (Col 3:9). Another
explanation would be: You have been circumcised with a circumcision made not with hands,
which circumcision made with hands consists in a putting off the body of flesh which is cut from
it. And so in another version of this passage we find &#8220;skin of the flesh,&#8221; instead of &#8220;body of
flesh,&#8221; that is, putting off a small part of the body which is flesh. (The meaning is not that the
body is one thing and the flesh another). Paul uses the word &#8220;flesh&#8221; to refer us back to the law,
where it speaks of flesh: &#8220;You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins&#8221; (Gen 17:11).
He uses this word also to show that it is a carnal observance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">105. &#8211; But we are not circumcised in that [physical] way, but with the circumcision of Christ. For
just as Christ accepted a likeness to sinful flesh, that is, flesh that could suffer, in order to free
us from sin, so he also accepted the remedies contained in the law, so that he could free us from
the observances of the law. Or, we could interpret the circumcision of Christ to mean the
circumcision which Christ accomplishes in us, which is a spiritual circumcision, as Romans
(2:29) says: &#8220;spiritual and not literal.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">106. &#8211; Secondly, he shows that we have received this circumcision in baptism, and so baptism
is a spiritual circumcision. And first, he shows that in baptism we have a symbol of Christ&#8217;s
death, secondly, that in baptism we receive a likeness to his resurrection (v. 12b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">107. &#8211; So Paul says: and you were buried with him in baptism, because in our baptism we find
a likeness to Christ&#8217;s death, and it is this: just as Christ was put into the tomb, after having been
put on the cross, so a person who is baptized is put under the water, and this is done three times,
just as Christ was three days in the tomb. Again, you were buried with him in baptism, that is,
your baptism was like the death of Christ, for as his death destroyed sin, so also does your
baptism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">108. &#8211; And just as Christ rose from the tomb, so we rise from our sins in the present, and from
the corruption of the flesh in hope. This is accomplished through faith in the working of God,
because it was by the power of God that Christ was raised: &#8220;Raise me up, that I may requite
them&#8221; (Ps 41:10). And by believing in this resurrection we come to share in it: &#8220;He who raised
Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies&#8221; (Rom 8:11). But Christ also
raised himself, because the action of the Father and of the Son is the same: &#8220;I will awake the
dawn&#8221; (Ps 108:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">109. &#8211; Then (v. 13), he shows the nature of this likeness. First, he states the likeness; and
secondly, how we are freed from our sins (v. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">110. &#8211; The text is not difficult. I said that you have been circumcised, because you have been
buried, in baptism, with Christ. And he compared baptism to the burial and death of Christ. Yet
one could say that it would be more to the point to say that Paul first shows that baptism is a
circumcision. And secondly, he shows why it is a circumcision, that is, because sin is superfluous
and the foreskin is superfluous. And so to remove sin and to remove the foreskin are the same.
Now sin is removed in baptism. Therefore, baptism is the same as a circumcision. And so Paul
says, and you, who were dead in trespasses, that is, because of your sins: &#8220;The death of sinners
is the worst&#8221; (Ps 34:21), and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, that is, in your carnal
concupiscence, which is related to original sin, as though they were chained with a debt of evil
actions and of mortal sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">111. &#8211; God made you alive: &#8220;God, when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive
together with Christ&#8221; (Eph 2:5). He made you alive by removing every sin from you, forgiving
and remitting all your faults. Thus, to be circumcised is the same as to be made alive, for the
same baptism removes the death of sin and circumcises us by cutting off original sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">112. &#8211; But how has God forgiven us? I answer that a person incurs two things by sinning, that
is, a debt of guilt, and slavery to the devil. And so he explains how sins are forgiven: first, our
being freed from slavery to the devil-, and secondly, he mentions the removing of the debt of
guilt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">113. &#8211; He says, having canceled the bond which stood against us. This bond or written decree
can be understood in two ways. In one way it is the Old Law: &#8220;By abolishing in his flesh the law
of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the
two&#8221; (Eph 2:15). This is its meaning when he is here speaking in reference to the Jews, as if to
say: and you ... God made alive. Again, a written bond is a warranty usually employed in
contracts. And whoever violates God&#8217;s bond is subject to a debt of punishment. This violation
is retained in the person&#8217;s memory, which it disturbs and stains; it is retained in God&#8217;s memory,
who is to judge such matters; and in the memory of the devils, who will torment them. Now the
memory of this violation is called a bond. And it is Christ who has forgiven all by having
canceled the bond, that is, the memory of the transgression, which stood against us. The bond,
in both its meanings, was against us: the Law, because it gave mankind a knowledge of sin, but
did not help [in overcoming sin] , and the memory of our transgressions, for which we deserved
to be punished. The term bond is used because its violation is not forgiven in such a way as to
bring it about that there was never any sin. Rather, such sin is not remembered by God as
something to be punished; it is not remembered by the devils as something to accuse us of; and
we do not remember our sins as reasons for sorrow: &#8220;Blessed is he whose transgression is
forgiven, whose sin is covered&#8221; (Ps 32:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">114. &#8211; Another interpretation of this passage would be that Paul is here speaking in general, to
all, not just about the Jews. And then we can say that a command was given to the first man:
&#8220;You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die&#8221; (Gen 2:16). But man violated this
law, and the memory of this violation became a bond which stood against us. And Christ
canceled this. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">115. &#8211; How did Christ cancel this bond? On the cross, for this he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
It was the custom for a bond to be torn up once a person had fulfilled all his obligations. Now
man was in sin and Christ paid for this by his suffering: &#8220;What I did not steal must I now
restore?&#8221; (Ps 69:4). And therefore, at the moment of Christ&#8217;s death this bond was canceled and
destroyed. And so he says, this he set aside, nailing it to the cross, by which he took away our sin
by making satisfaction to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">116. &#8211; Then (v. 15), he shows how Christ freed us from the slavery of sin. For if a creditor holds
a man captive on account of a debt that he owes, it is not enough merely to pay the debt; the
person himself must also be freed. This is what Christ did. So Paul says, he disarmed [rather,
&#8220;despoiled&#8221;] the principalities and powers. This despoiling can refer to those saints who had died
before Christ&#8217;s passion; in this sense, Christ freed them from the lower world by despoiling the
devil: &#8220;As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your captives
free from the waterless pit&#8221; (Zech 9:11); &#8220;Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, and the
prey of the tyrant be rescued&#8221; (Is 49:25). But if we understand this as referring to the living, then
he despoiled them from the devils: &#8220;But when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes
him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoil&#8221; (Lk 11:22); &#8220;Now shall
the ruler of this world be cast out&#8221; (Jn 12:31). Thus he says, he despoiled the principalities and
powers, that is, the devils themselves: &#8220;Against the principalities, against the powers, against the
world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly
places&#8221; (Eph 6:12). And made a public example of them, that is, the saints, as one who had
authority in heaven, over the dead and the living, in the kingdom of his glory or of his grace. Or
we could say he made a public example of them, that is, he drove out the principalities from
mankind, &#8220;Awake, and put on strength, O arm of the Lord&#8221; (Is 51:9), and with a public judgment,
so it could be known that they were expelled. For at one time the world did serve idols, but not
now. Or we could say there was a public example, that is, before the multitude of angels, because
Christ descended into the lower world of the saints and ascended into heaven. Triumphing over
them in him, that is, in himself, in his own power. &#8220;By the power which enables him even to
subject all things to himself&#8221; (Phil 3:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">117. &#8211; Another version of this passage reads: &#8220;He put off his flesh, and exemplified the
principalities and powers, triumphing confidently.&#8221; &#8220;He put off his flesh,&#8221; that is, his mortality.
&#8220;Flesh and blood,&#8221; that is, the mortality of bodily corruption, &#8220;cannot inherit the kingdom of
God&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:50); &#8220;Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has
dominion over him&#8221; (Rom 6:9), &#8220;Even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of
view, we regard him thus no longer&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:16). &#8220;He exemplified,&#8221; he gave us an example of
how the principalities and powers are to be overcome. The meaning of the rest stays the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">16 Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or
with regard to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath. 17 These are only a shadow
of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. 18 Let no one disqualify
you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, taking his stand on
visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, 19 and not holding fast
to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its
joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. 20 If with Christ you
died to the elemental spirits of the universe, why do you live as if you still
belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations, 21 &#8220;Do not handle, Do
not taste, Do not touch&#8221; 22 (referring to things which all perish as they are used),
according to human precepts and doctrines? 23 These have indeed an appearance
of wisdom in promoting rigor of devotion and self-abasement and severity to the
body, but they are of no value, serving only to indulge the flesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">118. &#8211; Above, Paul showed that the law was fulfilled in Christ because of the circumcision he
received, for this is an acknowledgment of the law. Here, he concludes that they are not obliged
to observe the ceremonial commands of the law. There were four kinds of ceremonial matters:
sacrifices, sacred things, sacraments, and observances. The sacrifices were those things which
were immolated to God, such as sheep, oxen and the like. The sacred things included utensils and
religious festivals. There were three sacraments: circumcision, the paschal lamb, and the
consecration of priests. The observances were those matters that were related to the unique
customs in the life of the people of Israel, things such as food, clothing and the like. Some of the
above matters, such as the sacrifices, the utensils and so on, pertained only to some of the people;
other matters were connected to all the people. Paul does not mention those things which
pertained just to some, but only those which affected all, just as baptism now affects us all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">119. &#8211; He does mention the observances, because they abstained from certain foods, such as
four-legged animals that do not have a divided hoof (Lev 11:26). In regard to drink, a vessel
without a cover was unclean, as was anything in it. And so with respect to these matters he says,
let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, that is, let no one condemn you
for taking food and drink forbidden in the law: &#8220;Let not him who abstains pass judgment on him
who eats; for God has welcomed him&#8221; (Rom 14:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">120. &#8211; He also mentions sacred matters related to the religious festivals and ceremonies. Under
the Old Law there were continuous religious ceremonies, like the morning and evening sacrifices.
There were other ceremonies held at certain definite times. Some of these were held several times
during the year, as the sabbath every week, and the now moon every month. Others came only
once a year, as the Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles and Pentecost. The reason for all this is that
all religious ceremonies are held for the honor of God. Now we give honor to God either because
of something which is eternal, and thus we have continuous religious ceremonies; or we honor
him because of certain temporal benefits which affect all people. There are two such benefits.
First, the gift of creation; and thus we have the religious ceremony of the sabbath: &#8220;Remember
the sabbath day, to keep it holy&#8221; (Ex 20:8). The reason for keeping the sabbath is that God rested
on the seventh day. The allegorical reason for the sabbath is that it signifies Christ&#8217;s rest in the
tomb, and the anagogical reason would be that it signifies the soul&#8217;s rest in God. The other gift
is that of procreation and preservation, which are also for a time. And since the Jewish people
calculated the time by the moon, he says, a new moon. There are also other reasons for honoring
God, as a special rescue or deliverance; and so other festivals were added to the above. And so
he says, or with regard to a festival or a new moon, every month, or sabbath[s], every seventh
period. He says sabbath[s] because a sabbath is a rest, and they had several sabbaths: the seventh
day; and seven weeks, that is Pentecost, which is the end of the seventh week following the
Passover, which is the beginning of the year; and the seventh month; and the seventh year, when
sins are forgiven; and after seven periods of seven years there was a Jubilee. With this in mind
Paul says, or sabbath[s], meaning: Let no one condemn you for not observing these feasts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">121. &#8211; For these are only a shadow of what is to come, that is, of Christ. And when the truth
comes, the shadow should cease, but the substance belongs to Christ. When someone sees a
shadow, he expects the body or substantial reality to follow. Now the legal observances of the
law were the shadow going before Christ, and they signified his coming; and so Paul says, the
substance, that is, the truth of the thing, belongs to Christ, but the shadow belongs to the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">122. &#8211; Then (v. 18), he speaks against those who were trying to seduce and deceive them. First,
he warns them not to be misled; secondly, he argues against those already misled (v. 20). As to
the first, he cautions them about being misled; secondly, he shows how they might be deceived,
insisting on self-abasement; and thirdly, the shortcomings of those who would mislead them
(18b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">123. &#8211; He says, let no one [seduce] you away from the truth that I have told you: &#8220;Let no one
deceive you with empty words&#8221; (Eph 5:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">124. &#8211; For these pseudo-apostles were seducing them by their &#8220;humility,&#8221; bringing in
observances taken from the law, for they pretended to be holy. But holiness consists of two
things: a humble manner of life, and the worship of God. Now these people appeared to lead a
humble life since they seemed to have no care for the things of the world; and so Paul says they
were insisting on self-abasement. &#8220;There is one who is humble in an evil way, and within he is
full of deceit&#8221; (Sir. 19:23). Again, they claimed to be preaching out of reverence for God; and
so Paul says, and [religion] of angels: for religion, according to Cicero, consists in ceremonies
and worship for a divine nature: &#8220;Holding the form of religion but denying the power of it&#8221; (2
Tim 3:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">125. &#8211; The Gloss has this passage as reading, &#8220;in the religion of angels,&#8221; for in this way these
seducers wanted to seem like angels, that is, as messengers, of God: &#8220;Beware of false prophets,
who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing yet inwardly are ravenous wolves&#8221; (Mt 7:15). Or, &#8220;in the
religions of angels,&#8221; can be understood in a literal sense, because the Old Law was made known
by angels, as we see from Galatians (3:19); &#8220;For if the message declared by angels was valid and
every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect
such a great salvation?&#8221; (Heb 2:2). These people maintained that the worship mandated in the
law had to be kept, because it had been given through angels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">126. &#8211; The shortcomings of such people were threefold; they were defective in their knowledge,
in their justice, and in their faith. As to their knowledge, Paul says that such a person was taking
his stand on [things that were not seen], that is, things that were not understood. Such a one did
not know why the law was given: &#8220;Desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding
either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions&#8221; (1 Tim 1:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">127. &#8211; As to the justice of such persons he says they were puffed up without reason, in vain,
although they pretended to be humble. And he mentions two things. First, that their religion was
useless, because they went about without reason, in vain, that is, doing things that were of no
value for eternal life: &#8220;Their labors are unprofitable&#8221; (Wis 3:11); &#8220;Though her labor be in vain,
yet she has no fear restraining her&#8221; (Job 39:16). They also showed a false humility, and so he says
that such a one was puffed up by his sensuous mind. There is a difference between one who is
puffed up and one who is robust. A person who is robust is full with truth, while one who is
puffed up is empty, and just extended with wind. Therefore, those who are truly humble are full,
but those who are only puffed up are empty. &#8220;He will burst those who are puffed up&#8221; (Wis 4:19)
[Vulgate]. This is the meaning of 1 Corinthians (8:1): &#8220;Knowledge puffs up.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">128. &#8211; With regard to their faith he says that they were not holding fast to the Head, that is,
Christ, by faith. Such people are deceived, because without Christ they are in the dark: &#8220;If any
one does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords
with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit, he knows nothing&#8221; (1 Tim 6:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">129. &#8211; Why is Christ the Head? Paul answers: because the entire good of the body, which is the
Church, depends on him. For there are two goods in a natural body: the union or joining together
of its members and its growth. And the Church obtains these from Christ, for the entire body
depends on him: &#8220;We, though many, are one body in Christ&#8221; (Rom 12:5). In a body the members
are joined in two ways. One way is by contact, as the hand is joined to the wrist, and the wrist
to the forearm, and so on. The other way is by a connection, as being joined by nerves. And so
Paul refers to joints and ligaments. So also in the Church, its members are joined by faith and
understanding: &#8220;One Lord, one faith, one baptism&#8221; (Eph 4:5). But this is incomplete without the
ligaments of charity and the sacraments. Thus Paul says, nourished through ligaments, because
it is through charity that one person supplies another. This body is developed by Christ, because
it grows with a growth that is from God, that is, with a growth that God produces in us: &#8220;Blessed
are the men whose strength is in thee, ... they go from strength to strength&#8221; (Ps 84:5). Or, from
God, that is, from Christ, who, as God, increases the body, the Church being enlarged: &#8220;For the
equipment of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ&#8221; (Eph
4:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">130. &#8211; Then (v. 20), he rebukes those who have already been deceived. First, he bases the reason
for his rebuke on the condition of those who have been deceived; and secondly, on the matters
about which they were misled (22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">131. &#8211; Their condition was one of freedom, because just as they were dead to sin, so also they
were dead to the law. Thus they were not obliged to keep it. Paul says, therefore, If with Christ
you died, being dead to the law, to the [elements], that is, to the observances of the law (for the
Jewish people served the true God, but under the elements; while the Gentiles served the
elements themselves), why, since you know the truth, do you live as if you still belonged to the
world, like the Jews live? Why do you submit to regulations about what is to be handled and
eaten; regulations such as do not handle, because it is a sin; do not taste pork or eels (Lev 11:7,
11)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">132. &#8211; Then (v. 22), he describes these legal observances, saying that they are harmful, vain, and
burdensome; thus Paul says, which all perish as they are used, because after the passion of Christ
they were deadly to all those who placed their hope in them; but after grace had been spread
among the people, such things were deadly to all, absolutely. (I am saying this because it is the
opinion of Jerome and Augustine which I mentioned in commenting on the second chapter of
Galatians). And so they lead to destruction and death. Why, then, do we still read the Old
Testament? I answer that we read it as a witness, but not as something to be observed. Thus Paul
says, which all perish as they are used, that is, if they are not regarded merely as a witness, but
are observed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">133. &#8211; Further, things that are not founded on reason or authority are vain. But these things are
not founded on divine authority, but on human authority. Thus Paul says, according to human
precepts. But these precepts were from God, were they not? I say that they were, but were to be
only for a time, until the truth should come: &#8220;For the sake of your tradition you have made void
the word of God&#8221; (Mt 15:6). Furthermore, they are not founded on reason, because they have
indeed an appearance of wisdom [in superstition], meaning, they are based on reasons that lead
to superstition, that is, to a religion that is extreme and past its time. And their reasons lead to
self-abasement, which is not genuine, because a person who has been freed from the slavery of
the law by Christ, should not submit himself to this slavery again: &#8220;Do not submit again to a yoke
of slavery&#8221; (Gal 5:1). Sometimes precepts that do not rest on divine authority are observed
because they are useful for some human purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">134. &#8211; But this is not the case here, for these precepts considered in themselves are a burden. We
desire three things: rest, honor and a fulness; and these are not produced by these legal
observances. For the ban on foods is opposed to fulness, and becomes a burden because so many
rules are involved. Further, these observances do not produce honor, but bring much confusion,
as when ashes are sprinkled about, and the like: &#8220;A yoke upon the disciples which neither our
fathers nor we have been able to bear&#8221; (Ac 15:10). Such practices lead to a severity to the body,
that is, the Church, and not to the honor of God; rather they serve only to indulge the flesh, i.e.,
to satisfy carnal desire.</p>

appear with him in glory. 5 Put to death therefore what is earthly in you:
immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.
6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming [upon the children of despair].
7 In these you once walked, when you lived in them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">135. &#8211; Above, the Apostle warned the faithful about those who wished to deceive them; here he
teaches them to avoid evil habits. First, he gives his teaching in a general way; secondly, he
presents it in more detail (v. 18). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he teaches them
to have a right intention in regard to their end, and in the second place, he instructs them about
the rectitude of their human actions (v. 5). The first is divided into two parts. First, he gives the
main idea of his teaching, seek the things that are above; and secondly, he gives the reason why
they should do so, for you have died. In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions
the benefit they have received; secondly, he draws his conclusion, set your minds on things that
are above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">136. &#8211; The benefit that we have received is that, with the resurrection of Christ, we also have
risen. And we have risen in two ways. First, by a hope for our bodily resurrection: &#8220;Now if Christ
is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the
dead?&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:12). In the second way, with the resurrection of Christ we are restored to the
life of justice: &#8220;He was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification&#8221; (Rom
4:25). Paul is saying in effect: When Christ arose, you also arose: &#8220;He who raised the Lord Jesus
will raise us also with Jesus,&#8221; as we read in 2 Corinthians (4:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">137. &#8211; Then when he says, set your minds on things that are above, he draws his conclusion about
the end: first, that a person should aim at some principal end; and secondly, that he should judge
other things in the light of that end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">138. &#8211; Paul says, therefore, If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are
above: &#8220;Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well&#8221;
(Mt 6:33). For this is our end: &#8220;One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life&#8221; (Ps 27:4). Therefore, seek this, where
Christ is, seated at the right hand of God: &#8220;So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them,
was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God&#8221; (Mk 16:19); &#8220;Sit at my right
hand&#8221; (Ps 110:1). By &#8220;the right hand of God&#8221; he does not mean a member of a body, but he is
speaking figuratively, for the right hand of a person is the stronger. Christ sits at the right hand
of the Father because, as man, he shares in the stronger and better goods of the Father, while as
God, Christ is equal to the Father. Consequently, you should have this intention: that just as
Christ died and arose, and was taken up to sit at the right hand of God, so you should die to sin
in order to live a life of justice and so be taken up into glory. Or, we could say, that we arose
through Christ; but he is seated at the right hand of God, and so our desire should be to be with
him: &#8220;Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together&#8221; (Mt 24:28); &#8220;Where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also&#8221; (Mt 6:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">139. &#8211; Furthermore, we should judge of other things in the light of Christ; and so Paul says, set
your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. Here he is affirming one way
of life, and rejecting another. A person sets his mind on things that are above, when he governs
his life according to heavenly ideas, and judges all things by such ideas: &#8220;The wisdom from
above&#8221; (Jas. 3:17). And a person sets his mind on things that are on earth when he orders and
judges all things according to earthly goods, considering them the highest goods: &#8220;They glory in
their shame, with minds set on earthly things&#8221; (Phil 3:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">140. &#8211; When Paul continues, for you have died, he gives the reason for his advice. First, he
mentions their death; secondly, their hidden life (v. 3b); and thirdly, he teaches when this life will
be revealed (v. 4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">141. &#8211; Just before, Paul had rejected one way of life and affirmed another. Now he returns to
these two ways. As to the first he says: Do not set your minds on earthly things, because you have
died to an earthly way of life. And a person who has died to this kind of life does not set his mind
on the things of this world. This is the way you should act if you have died, with Christ, to the
elements of this world: &#8220;So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in
Christ Jesus&#8221; (Rom 6:11); &#8220;They are dead, they will not live&#8221; (Is 26:14). When he said [above,
in Romans], &#8220;consider yourselves dead,&#8221; he followed this with, &#8220;and alive&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">142. &#8211; And so there is another life which is hidden. And thus Paul also says here, and your life
is hid with Christ in God. We acquire this life through Christ. &#8220;For Christ also died for sins once
for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God&#8221; (1 Pet. 3:18). But
because this life is obtained through Christ, and Christ is hidden from us because he is in the
glory of the Father, this life which is given to us through him is also hidden, namely, where
Christ is, in the glory of the Father: &#8220;Long life is in his right hand; in his left hand are riches and
honor&#8221; (Prov 3:16); &#8220;O how abundant is your goodness, which you have laid up for those who
fear you&#8221; (Ps 31:19); &#8220;To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna&#8221; (Rev 2:17). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">143. &#8211; When he says, when Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with him in
glory, he shows how this life will be manifested, that is, just as Christ&#8217;s; for we read, &#8220;Our God
comes&#8221; (Ps 50:3). And so Paul says, when Christ who is our life appears, because he is the
Author of our life, and because our life consists in knowing and loving him: &#8220;It is no longer I
who live, but Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal 2:20). When Christ appears then you also will appear:
&#8220;When he appears we shall be like him&#8221; (1 Jn 3:2), that is, in glory: &#8220;God came from Teman, and
the Holy One from Mount Paran&#8221; (Hab 3:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">144. &#8211; Next (v. 5), Paul puts order into their actions: first, by restraining them from sin; secondly,
by teaching them about good habits (v. 12). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he
starts with a warning; secondly, he explains it (v. 9b). The first is divided into two parts: first,
he forbids carnal vices; secondly, he gives his reason (v. 6). With respect to the first he does two
things: first, he lays down a general prohibition; secondly, he goes into detail about it (v. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">145. &#8211; He says, put to death therefore [your members that are on earth] : You ought not to set
your minds on things that are on earth, but put to death whatever is earthly, and in particular, your
members that are on earth. We can explain this by making a comparison: our life involves many
actions, just as our body contains many members. In a good life, prudence is like the eye, which
directs a person; and courage is like the feet, which support and carry him. But in an evil life,
craftiness becomes the eye, and obstinacy becomes the feet. Therefore, these members must be
put to death. Or we could say that in reference to the members of the body, he had said, &#8220;you
have died&#8221; (v. 3), that is, to an earthly way of life. But how is this death accomplished? He
answers: put to death your members. Thus, to the extent we have died to sin, to that extent we
are alive with grace. For the life of grace heals us with respect to our mind; but not entirely as
to our body, because it retains a tendency to sin: &#8220;I of myself serve the law of God with my mind,
but with my flesh I serve the law of sin&#8221; (Rom 7:25); and he said, a little before this: &#8220;I see in my
members another law at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin
which dwells in my members&#8221; (v. 23). Therefore, because you have died so far as concerns your
mind, put to death the sinful desires in your members that are on earth, insofar as they are on
earth and are earthly bodies: &#8220;I pommel my body and subdue it&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:27), by not allowing
it to be drawn to carnal things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">146. &#8211; Now he mentions particular sins: first, those that are purely carnal; secondly, those that
are partly carnal. Among the carnal sins, we are inclined to lust especially by concupiscence.
Lustful actions are shameful and although they may accord with the nature of man as animal, they
are not fitting to it as rational, because every sin is opposed to reason. And so Paul says,
immorality: &#8220;Beware, my son, of all immorality&#8221; (Job 4:12). Or, a sin can be against nature, and
so he says, impurity. Again, pleasure might be impure, and so he says, passion; and desire can
be depraved, and so he says, evil desire. Secondly, he lists the intermediate sins. The first of these
is covetousness, whose object is something corporeal, that is, money, but it is completed in a
spiritual delight, that is, in the ownership of such. And thus it has some part among the carnal
sins. Paul adds, which is idolatry: &#8220;one who is covetous that is, an idolater,&#8221; as Ephesians (5:5)
says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">147. &#8211; But is covetousness by its nature really a kind of idolatry, and does a covetous person sin
as an idolater sins? I say, not specifically, but by resemblance, because a covetous person puts
his very life in money. We have idolatry when someone gives to some image the honor owed to
God; but a covetous person gives to money the honor owed to God, because he builds his whole
life around it. But because a covetous person intends to act towards money as to God, like an
idolater, it is a lesser sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">148. &#8211; Then when Paul says, on account of these the wrath of God is coming, he gives the reason
why these sins should be avoided. There are two reasons: the first applies to all; the second
applies especially to them. The first is God&#8217;s punishment, because on account of carnal sins the
wrath of God, that is, God&#8217;s punishment, is coming [upon the children of despair], that is,
sinners. Such sinners despair of God because lust is the offspring of despair, since many people
abandon themselves entirely to things of the flesh because they have despaired of spiritual things.
Or, he says children of despair, because of themselves there is no hope for their correction. And
so the wrath of God is coming, as in the flood (Gen 6, 7), and on the people of Sodom. The other
reason they have for avoiding these sins is that once they did live that way; and so Paul says, in
these you once walked, from bad to worse. He gives them this reason, first, because of what Peter
says: &#8220;Let the time that is past suffice for doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in
licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry&#8221; (1 Pet. 4:3).
Secondly, he mentions this reason because they knew from their own experience that such
conduct is not beneficial, but only brings disorder: &#8220;But then what return did you get from the
things of which you are now ashamed,&#8221; as we read in Romans (6:21).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">3-2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Col. 3:8-11</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8 But now put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk from
your mouth. 9 Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old
nature with its practices 10 and have put on the new nature, which is being
renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. 11 Here there cannot be
Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free
man, but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">149. &#8211; Above, the Apostle warned the faithful about sins of the flesh; here he warns them about
spiritual sins. First, he lays down a general admonition; and secondly, he divides it into parts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">150. &#8211; So he says: At one time you walked in sins, but now put them all away, not only sins of
the flesh, but all sin: &#8220;So put away all malice and all guile and insincerity and envy and all
slander&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">151. &#8211; He divides the spiritual sins into two groups: first, into sins of the heart, secondly, into sins
of the mouth, spoken sins. First of all, he mentions anger: &#8220;For the anger of man does not work
the righteousness of God&#8221; (Jas. 1:20); and this must be avoided. Secondly, he mentions wrath,
which springs from anger, and occurs when a person considers someone unworthy of what he
has, or in comparison with another: &#8220;I have no wrath&#8221; (Is 27:4). Malice then follows after these
two, when a person tries to cause injury to his neighbor: &#8220;Put away all filthiness and rank growth
of wickedness&#8221; (Jas. 1:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">152. &#8211; Then he mentions those sins committed by word; and there are three kinds. Such sins
indicate a spiritual disorder. First, such a sin in relation to God is [blasphemy] : &#8220;Bring out of the
camp him who blasphemed; and let all who hear him lay their hands upon his head, and let all
the congregation stone him&#8221; (Lev 24:14). And thus all blasphemy is a grievous sin. But what if
it is sudden? I answer that if it is so sudden that a person does not realize that he is blaspheming,
it is not a grievous sin. But I believe that however suddenly, if a person realizes that he is
speaking blasphemous words, he sins in a grievous way. Secondly, he mentions a disorder
concerning concupiscence, when he says, put foul talk from your mouth: &#8220;Let no evil talk come
out of your mouths&#8221; (Eph 4:29). Thirdly, he mentions a disorder in relation to our neighbor,
lying: &#8220;A false witness will not go unpunished&#8221; (Prov 19:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">153. &#8211; Then when he says, seeing that you have put off the old nature, he shows why the vices
he has just mentioned must be avoided, the reason being that when one puts off what is old, he
should put on what is new: &#8220;No one sews an old patch on a new garment,&#8221; as we read in Matthew
(9:16). First, he talks of putting off what is old, secondly, of putting on what is new (v. 10). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">154. &#8211; So Paul tells us to get rid of these things, put off the old nature, because it has grown old
by sin: &#8220;What is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away&#8221; (Heb 8:13). This
old nature, this old self, is approaching decay, because sin is the road to decay. In addition, sin
destroys virtue and spiritual beauty. The oldness of our nature, of course, was brought in by the
sin of our first parent: &#8220;Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death through
sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned&#8221; (Rom 5:12). This old nature,
therefore, or old self, is the oldness of sin: &#8220;We know that our old self was crucified with him so
that the sinful body might be destroyed&#8221; (Rom 6:6). We are to put off this old self with its
practices: &#8220;Put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt
through deceitful lusts&#8221; (Eph 4:22). The new nature or self is the mind, renewed from within,
because before grace our mind is subject within to sin, and when it is renewed by grace it
becomes new: &#8220;Your youth is renewed like the eagle&#8217;s&#8221; (Ps 103:5); &#8220;For neither circumcision
counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation&#8221; (Gal 6:15). This new creation is
renewing grace. Yet, there is an oldness that still remains in our flesh. Nevertheless, if you follow
the judgment of the new nature, the new self, you are putting on the new nature or new self; while
if you lust according to the desires of the flesh, you are putting on the old self or nature: &#8220;Put on
the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness&#8221; (Eph 4:24).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">155. &#8211; Then when Paul says, and have put on the new nature, he describes the new self. First, he
shows how this renewal takes place; secondly, where it takes place. He shows that the inner self,
having become old by its ignorance of God, is made new by faith and the knowledge of God:
&#8220;We are being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another&#8221; (2 Cor 3:18). And
where is this renewal taking place? It is taking place where the image of God is, and this is not
in the sense faculties, but in the mind. And so Paul says, after [in the sense of &#8220;with respect to&#8221;]
the image of its creator. In other words, the image of God in us is being renewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">156. &#8211; Then (v. 11), he shows that this renewal is for every one, otherwise it would not pertain
to human nature as such. And this renewal pertains to all because it was accomplished with
respect to what is common to all. Here then we have five ways in which people are different. The
first way is by sex, which Paul excludes when he says, here there cannot be [male and female],
because men and women do not differ in mind, but in their physical sex. Secondly, people are
made different by their native lands, and Paul excludes this when he says, Greek and Jew. For
although the Jews were believers and the Greeks unbelievers, yet both have rational minds: &#8220;Or
is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also?&#8221; (Rom 3:29). The third
distinction is based on rite [as the rite of circumcision] , for some had the law, while others did
not; yet &#8220;The same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon Him,&#8221; as
Romans (10:12) says. A fourth difference is in language: barbarian, Scythian. Scythia is toward
the North. What is barbarous is what is foreign or alien. Thus barbarians are foreigners, and one
is absolutely a barbarian who is alien to human nature as such, that is, insofar as it is rational.
And so barbarians are those people who are not ruled by reason and laws; they are slaves by
nature. But there is no difference in Christ, because although they do not have the civil law, they
still have the law of Christ. The final difference is based on state: for some are slave, and others
free; but in Christ they are all alike: &#8220;The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from
his master&#8221; (Job 3:19). Therefore, none of these differences exist in Christ, but Christ is all, and
in all. For circumcision is obtained through Christ alone, and freedom comes from Christ alone.
If you are not free, Christ is your freedom; if you are not circumcised, Christ is your
circumcision, and so on. And Christ is in all, because he gives his gifts to all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">12 Put on then, as God&#8217;s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness,
lowliness, meekness, and patience, 13 forbearing one another and, if one has a
complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so
you also must forgive. 14 And above all these put on love, which binds
everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in
your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.
16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as you teach and admonish one
another in all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, and hymns and spiritual songs
with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 17 And whatever you do, in word or
deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the
Father through him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">157. &#8211; Above, the Apostle urged the faithful to avoid evil, and here he urges them to accomplish
what is good: first, he urges the acts of the particular virtues, and secondly, the acts of those
principal virtues that perfect the others (v. 14). First, he reminds them of their present condition;
secondly, he gives a list of the virtues (v. 12b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">158. &#8211; Paul says: If you have put on the new self, you should put on the parts of the new self, that
is, the virtues: &#8220;Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light&#8221; (Rom
13:12). We put these on when our exterior actions are made pleasing by the virtues. But which
virtues? Some things are appropriate for soldiers, other things for priests. Put on then what is
appropriate for yourself, as God&#8217;s chosen ones, holy and beloved. When he says chosen, this
refers to the taking away of evil; and holy, refers to the gift of grace. &#8220;But you were washed, you
were sanctified&#8221; (1 Cor 6:11); &#8220;You shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy&#8221; (Lev 19:2).
When he says beloved, he is referring to their preparation for future glory: &#8220;He loved them to the
end,&#8221; that is, of eternal life (Jn 13:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">159. &#8211; Then, he describes what we are to put on and which will protect us in good times and in
bad times: &#8220;With the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left&#8221; (2 Cor 6:7).
First, he mentions what we must have in prosperity, and secondly, in times of adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">160. &#8211; When times are good we owe compassion or mercy to our neighbor; and so Paul says,
compassion: &#8220;Through the tender mercy of our God, when the day shall dawn upon us from on
high&#8221; (Lk 1:78); &#8220;If there is any affection and sympathy&#8221; (Phil 3:1), that is, compassion springing
from love. Secondly, we must show kindness to all. Kindness [benignitas] is like a good fire
[bona igneitas]. For fire melts and thaws what is moist, and if there is a good fire in you it will
melt and thaw what is moist. It is the Holy Spirit who does this: &#8220;The Spirit of wisdom is kind&#8221;
(Wis 1:6); &#8220;Be kind to one another&#8221; (Eph 4:32). Lowliness or humility should be found in your
hearts: &#8220;The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself&#8221; (Sir 3:18). In external matters
you should practice [moderation], which consists in a certain limit, so that you do not go to
extremes in times of prosperity: &#8220;Let all men know of your moderation,&#8221; as Philippians (4:5)
says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">161. &#8211; In the bad times of adversity three kinds of armor are necessary. First, patience, which
keeps the soul from giving up the love of God and what is right because of difficulties: &#8220;You will
save your souls by patience&#8221; (Lk 21:19). Sometimes it happens that a person does what is right
if he alone is involved, yet he finds that the traits of other persons are insufferable; and to these
he says, forbearing one another: &#8220;For by what that righteous man saw and heard as he lived
among them, he was vexed in his righteous soul day after day with their lawless deeds&#8221; (2 Pet
2:8); &#8220;We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please
ourselves,&#8221; as we read in Romans (15:1). Thirdly, the armor of pardon is necessary, and so he
says, forgiving each other: &#8220;What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your
sake in the presence of Christ&#8221; (2 Cor 2:10). One forgives an injury when he does not hold a
grudge against the person who did it to him, and does not injure him in return. Still, when
punishment is necessary, the person committing the injury must be punished. Paul adds the
reason why they should forgive, as the Lord has forgiven you: &#8220;Does a man harbor anger against
another, and yet seek for healing from the Lord?&#8221; (Sir 28:3); &#8220;1 forgave you all that debt because
you besought me&#8221; (Mt 18:32), and then he continues, &#8220;and should not you have had mercy on
your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">162. &#8211; Then when Paul says, and above all these put on love, he urges them to practice the
principal virtues, which perfect the others. Among the virtues, the love of charity holds first
place; while among the gifts, wisdom is first. For love is the soul of all the virtues, while wisdom
directs them. First, he leads them to the practice of love, and secondly to wisdom (v. 16). First,
he urges them to possess the love of charity; secondly, to possess the effects of this love (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">163. &#8211; So Paul says, above all these put on love, which is greater than all the virtues mentioned
above, as we find stated in 1 Corinthians (13:13). Above all these, that is, more than all the
others, because love is the end of all the virtues: &#8220;The end of the commandment is love&#8221; (1 Tim
1:5). Or we could say, above all these we should have love, because it is above all the rest: &#8220;I will
show you a still more excellent way&#8221; (1 Cor 12:31). Love is above all the rest because without
it the others are of no value. This love is the seamless tunic mentioned by John (19:23). The
reason we need this love is because it binds everything together in perfect harmony. According
to the Gloss, all the virtues perfect man, but love unites them to each other and makes them
permanent; and this is why it is said to bind. Or, it is said to bind because it binds of its very
nature, for love unites the beloved to the lover: &#8220;I led them with cords of compassion, with the
bands of love&#8221; (Hos 11:4). He says, perfect, because a thing is perfect when it holds firmly to its
ultimate end; and love does this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">164. &#8211; Then (v. 15), he urges them to acts of love. He mentions two of these acts, peace and
thankfulness, and implies a third, joy. He says, let the peace of Christ [rejoice] in your hearts. An
immediate effect of the love of charity is peace, which is, as Augustine comments, that
composure or calmness of order produced in a person by God. Love does this, because when one
loves another he harmonizes his will with the other: &#8220;Great peace have those who love thy law&#8221;
(Ps 119:165). He says rejoice, because the effect of this love is joy, and this joy follows peace:
&#8220;Joy follows those who take counsels of peace&#8221; (Prov 12:20). Paul does not merely say &#8220;peace,&#8221;
because there is a peace of this world which God did not come to bring. He says, the peace of
Christ, the peace Christ established between God and man. Jesus affirmed this peace: &#8220;Jesus
himself stood among them, and said to them: Peace to you&#8221; (Lk 24:36). And you should have this
peace, because it is the peace ... to which indeed you were called. &#8220;God has called us to peace&#8221;
(1 Cor 7:15). He adds, in the one body, that is, that you may be in one body. Another effect is
thankfulness, and so Paul continues, and be thankful: &#8220;The hope of the unthankful will melt away
like the winter&#8217;s ice&#8221; (Wis 16:29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">165. &#8211; Next (v. 16), he urges them to acquire wisdom, first, he teaches them about the source of
wisdom, and secondly its usefulness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">166. &#8211; In order to have true wisdom, one must inquire into its source, and so Paul says, let the
word of Christ dwell in you richly. &#8220;The source of wisdom is God&#8217;s word in the highest heaven&#8221;
(Sir 1:5). Therefore you should draw wisdom from the word of Christ: &#8220;That will be your
wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples&#8221; (Deut 4:6); &#8220;He was made our
wisdom&#8221; (1 Cor 1:30). But some people do not have the Word, and so they do not have wisdom.
He says that this wisdom should dwell in us: &#8220;Bind them about your neck, write them on the
tablet of your heart&#8221; (Prov 3:3). For some, a little of Christ&#8217;s word is enough, but the Apostle
wants them to have much more; thus he says, let the word of God dwell in you richly: &#8220;God is
able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have enough of
everything&#8221; (2 Cor 9:8); &#8220;Search for it as for hidden treasures&#8221; (Prov 2:4). He adds, in all
wisdom, that is, you should want to know everything that pertains to the wisdom of Christ: &#8220;I did
not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God&#8221; (Acts 20:27); &#8220;The heart of a fool
is like a broken jar; it will hold no wisdom&#8221; (Sir 21:17) [Vulgate].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">167. &#8211; This wisdom is useful in three ways: for instruction, for devotion, and for direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">168. &#8211; It instructs us in two ways: first, to know what is true; and so Paul says, as you teach. He
is saying, in effect: this wisdom dwells in you so richly that it can teach you all things: &#8220;All
scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for
training in righteousness&#8221; (2 Tim 3:16). Secondly, this wisdom instructs us to know what is good,
and so Paul says, and admonish one another, that is, encourage yourselves to do good things: &#8220;To
arouse you by way of reminder&#8221; (2 Pet 1:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">169. &#8211; Secondly, he mentions its usefulness for devotion, saying, as you sing psalms and hymns.
The psalms show the delight of acting well: &#8220;Praise him with joy&#8221; (Ps 148:2 / 47:1). A hymn is
a song of praise: &#8220;A hymn for all his saints&#8221; (Ps 148:14). And spiritual songs with thankfulness
in your hearts to God, because whatever we do, we should relate it to spiritual goods, to the
eternal promises, and to the worship of God. And so Paul says, in your hearts, not only with your
lips: &#8220;I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also&#8221; (1 Cor 14:15); &#8220;This people
draws near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me&#8221; (Is
29:13). He adds, with thankfulness, that is, acknowledging the grace of Christ and God&#8217;s gifts.
The chief songs of the Church are songs of the heart; but they are expressed vocally so as to
arouse the songs of the heart, and for the benefit of the simple and uncultured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">170. &#8211; He mentions the usefulness of this wisdom in directing our actions when he says, and
whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, because
even our speaking is a work: &#8220;Whether your eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory
of God&#8221; (1 Cor 10:31). Some find a difficulty in this statement of Paul: for what he is saying is
either a command or a counsel. If it is a command, then whoever does not do this sins; yet a
person sins venially when he does not do this; therefore, whoever sins venially sins mortally. My
answer is this: Some say that this is a counsel; but this is not true. Nevertheless, it is not
necessary that we refer everything to God in an actual way; it can be done habitually. Whoever
acts against the glory of God and his commands, acts against this command. But one who sins
venially does not act against this command in an absolute way, because even though he does not
refer everything to God in an actual way, he does so habitually.</p>

<A NAME="34"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">3-4</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">18 Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 19 Husbands,
love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. 20 Children, obey your parents
in everything, for this pleases the Lord. 21 Fathers, do not provoke your children,
lest they become discouraged. 22 Slaves, obey in everything those who are your
earthly masters, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart,
fearing the Lord. 23 Whatever your task, work heartily, as serving the Lord and
not men, 24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your
reward; you are serving the Lord Christ. 25 For the wrong-doer will be paid back
for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality. 4:1 Masters, treat your slaves
justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">171. &#8211; Having given a general direction to all, Paul now begins to give particular directions. First,
he gives special directions which relate to the various states found in the Church; secondly,
certain directions which apply to all states in certain conditions (4:2). There are three special
directions, according to the three kinds of relationships the Philosopher finds in domestic society:
that of husband and wife; father and child; and the master and slaves (v. 22). Each of these is
divided into two parts insofar as he urges subjects to obey and their superiors to govern with
moderation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">172. &#8211; He says, wives, be subject to your husbands, and adds, as is fitting, because this has been
decreed by God&#8217;s law: &#8220;You shall be under your husband&#8217;s power, and he shall have dominion
over you&#8221; (Gen 3:16); &#8220;The women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not
permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says&#8221; (1 Cor 14:34). The reason
for this is that ruling is a function of reason; and because men&#8217;s reason is stronger, they should
preside. He adds, in the Lord, because all things directed to certain ends must ultimately be
referred to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">173. &#8211; Then, he instructs husbands to love their wives, husbands, love your wives; because this
is natural, since a husband and wife are in a certain sense one: &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, as
Christ loved the Church&#8221; (Eph 5:25). He forbids them to be bitter: &#8220;She who is bitter becomes
weak in doing good&#8221; (Mic 1:12), &#8220;Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
be put away from you, with all malice&#8221; (Eph 4:31).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">174. &#8211; Then he deals with the second relationship, and says, children, obey your parents in
everything, that is, everything that is not contrary to God: &#8220;We have had earthly fathers to
discipline us and we respected them&#8221; (Heb 12:9). But if they command anything which is
contrary to God, then we must remember what is said in Luke: &#8220;If any one comes to me and does
not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even
his own life, he cannot be my disciple&#8221; (14:26). This is to be done for this pleases the Lord, that
is, it is in the Lord&#8217;s law, because the law of charity does not destroy the law of nature, but
perfects it. And it is a natural law that a child is subject to the care of his father: &#8220;Honor your
father and your mother&#8221; (Ex 20:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">175. &#8211; Then when Paul says, fathers, do not provoke your children, he instructs parents: &#8220;Fathers,
do not provoke your children to anger&#8221; (Eph 6:4). They should not do this lest they become
discouraged, that is, faint-hearted. Paul gives this advice because adults keep the impressions
they have had as children. And it is natural for those raised in slavery to be always faint-hearted.
This is the reason why some say that the children of Israel were not immediately led into the
promised land: they had been raised in slavery, and would not have had the courage to fight
against their enemies: &#8220;Say to those who are of a fearful heart: Be strong, fear not!&#8221; (Is 35:4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">176. &#8211; Next, he considers the third relationship. First, he instructs the slaves; secondly, he gives
the reason for what he says (v. 24); and thirdly, he clears up a question (v. 25). As to the first, he
does two things: first, he tells them to obey; and secondly, how to obey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">177. &#8211; He says, slaves, according to your state in this world, obey in everything, that is, in
everything that is not against God, those who are your earthly masters: &#8220;Not only to the kind and
gentle but also to the overbearing&#8221; (1 Pet 2:18); &#8220;Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard
their masters as worthy of all honor&#8221; (1 Tim 6:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">178. &#8211; Then when he says, not with eyeservice, he teaches them how they are to obey. He shows
them two ways to obey: first, with simplicity and without trickery; secondly, willingly. So Paul
says, not with eyeservice, that is, not merely to the extent that they can be seen by their master.
This same idea is found in Ephesians (6:6). He says, not as men-pleasers, for such persons serve
merely to please men. As Galatians says (1:10): &#8220;If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a
servant of Christ&#8221;. And therefore he adds, but in singleness of heart, that is, without trickery,
fearing the Lord, as in Job (1:1): &#8220;That man was simple and upright, and feared God&#8221;; &#8220;The
simplicity of the upright guides them&#8221; (Prov 11:3). Further, they should serve willingly; and so
Paul says, whatever your task, work heartily, that is, readily. And they are to do this as serving
the Lord, because one who serves another because it is the right thing to do does this because of
God, the source of what is right: &#8220;He who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed&#8221;
(Rom 13:2); &#8220;Doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a good will as to the
Lord and not to men&#8221; (Eph 6:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">179. &#8211; Next, he gives two reasons why they should serve this way. The first considers their
reward, and the second considers their devotion to God. So Paul says: Serve readily, because
from the Lord you will receive the eternal inheritance as your reward: &#8220;The lines have fallen for
me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage&#8221; (Ps 16:6); &#8220;Knowing that whatever good
any one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free&#8221; (Eph
6:8). Some people were of the opinion that it is not meritorious to accomplish an act of justice,
because this seems to be owed to someone, and it is not meritorious to give to someone what is
his due. But we should remember that by the very fact that we do this voluntarily, we are doing
something of ourselves, because it is in our power to will or not to will; and so such an act is
meritorious. Now slaves serve their masters because they owe this to them; and therefore, in
order to receive their reward, they should do this voluntarily. But they should serve their masters
in such a way that they do not separate themselves from God. The second reason for serving this
way is that this is the way one serves the Lord; as we read in Romans (12:11): &#8220;Be aglow with
the Spirit, serve the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">180. &#8211; Then (v. 25), he clears up a question. For a slave might ask: How can I serve a person who
harms me? And so Paul replies. It is not up to you to take revenge by taking away from him what
is his; rather, wait for the one who can, for the wrong-doer will be paid back for the wrong he has
done: &#8220;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive
good or evil, according to what he has done in the body&#8221; (2 Cor 5:10); &#8220;There is no partiality
with him [God] &#8220; (Eph 6:9); and also in Acts (10:34): &#8220;God shows no partiality&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">181. &#8211; Next, Paul shows how masters should treat their slaves. He does two things: first, he gives
his instructions, secondly, the reason for them. There are two ways a master can oppress his
slaves. First, by acting unjustly against them by violating the laws, for according to the laws a
master cannot be cruel to his slaves. And so Paul says that masters should treat their slaves justly.
Secondly, by demanding that their slaves accomplish absolutely all their duties, which a Christian
gentleness would soften; and so Paul says, fairly: &#8220;If I have rejected the cause of my manservant
or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me; what then shall I do when God
rises up?&#8221; as we read in Job (31:13). Then when he says, knowing that you also have a Master
in heaven, Paul gives the reason why they should act this way, and it is this: just as you act
towards your slaves, so the Lord will act towards you: &#8220;Knowing that he who is both their Master
and yours is in heaven&#8221; (Eph 6:9).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2 Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving; 3 and
pray for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the
mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison, 4 that I may make it clear,
as I ought to speak. 5 Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the
most of the time. 6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that
you may know how you ought to answer every one. 7 Tychicus will tell you all
about my affairs; he is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant
in the Lord. 8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know
how we are and that he may encourage your hearts, 9 and with him Onesimus, the
faithful and beloved brother, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you of every
thing that has taken place here. 10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and
Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions
- if he comes to you, receive him), 11 and Jesus who is called Justus. These are
the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of
God, and they have been a comfort to me. 12 Epaphras, who is one of yourselves,
a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always remembering you earnestly in his
prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God. 13 For
I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and
in Hierapolis. 14 Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 15 Give my
greetings to the brethren at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
16And when this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church
of the Laodiceans; and see that you read also the letter from Laodicea. 17 And say
to Archippus, &#8220;See that you fulfil the ministry which you have received in the
Lord.&#8221; 18 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my fetters.
Grace be with you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">182. &#8211; Above, Paul gave specific teachings for each class of persons; here he gives instructions
to everyone. First, he shows what their relationship to others ought to be; and secondly, how
some will be acting towards them (v. 7). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows
how they should act towards him, the Apostle, their prelate; and secondly, towards others,
especially, unbelievers (v. 5). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he urges them to pray
in general; secondly, to pray for him (v. 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">183. &#8211; Prayer should have three characteristics: it should be constant, alert, and with gratitude.
It should be constant, and so Paul says, continue steadfastly in prayer, that is, pray with
perseverance: &#8220;Pray constantly&#8221; (1 Thess 5:17); &#8220;They ought always to pray and not lose heart&#8221;
(Lk 18:1). It should also be alert, so that the mind does not become oppressed; and so Paul adds,
being watchful: &#8220;Watch with your prayers&#8221; (1 Pet 4:7); and in Luke we read: &#8220;All night he
continued in prayer to God&#8221; (Lk 6:12). Prayer should also be with gratitude, that is, with
thanksgiving; for if we are ungrateful for the good things we have received, we do not deserve
new favors. And so Paul continues, with thanksgiving: &#8220;Give thanks in all circumstances&#8221; (1
Thess 5:18); and in Philippians (4:6) we have &#8220;but in everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">184. &#8211; Next, Paul asks them to pray for him, saying, and pray for us also, because subjects should
pray for their prelates; for their prelates watch over them, and the welfare of the prelates affects
all of their subjects: &#8220;Pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed on and triumph&#8221; (2 Thess
3:1). They should pray that God may open to us a door for the word, that is, the door of our
mouth, through which the words coming from our heart pass; and they should pray that God give
to Paul the grace to preach his word in a fitting manner. This opening also points to something
great: &#8220;And he opened his mouth and taught them&#8221; (Mt 5:2); and so Paul adds, to declare the
mystery of Christ: &#8220;He utters mysteries in the Spirit&#8221; (1 Cor 14:2). And 1, Paul, need these things,
because I am suffering for the word of Christ. And so you must pray that I can do so boldly: &#8220;The
gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like a criminal&#8221; (2 Tim 2:9). You must pray
that God may open, that is, unblock, to us a door for the word.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">185. &#8211; There are three obstacles which can block the word. One is fear, and so Paul says, I am
in prison. The second is its profundity, so that it cannot be understood by the faithful; and so Paul
says, that I may make it clear. The third obstacle is that the way it is preached or the time may
not be appropriate; and so Paul says, as I ought to speak. &#8220;But I brethren, could not address you
as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh&#8221; (1 Cor 3:1); &#8220;Who then is the faithful and wise steward
whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper
time?&#8221; (Lk 12:42).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">186. &#8211; Then (v. 5), he shows how they should act towards outsiders: first, as to their manner of
life; secondly, in what they say (v. 6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">187. &#8211; Paul says, conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, that is, unbelievers. And do so
wisely, with wisdom: &#8220;For God loves nothing so much as the man who lives with wisdom&#8221; (Wis
7:28). The reason for doing this is that they may be making the most of the time. A person makes
the most of his trouble when he overlooks what is owing to him, in order to avoid trouble. Now,
they were being troubled by these outsiders. And so Paul wants them to make the most of this
trouble by means of wisdom: &#8220;Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles&#8221; (1 Pet 2:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">188. &#8211; Paul also instructs them as to their speech. First, it should be gracious; and so he says, let
your speech always be gracious; &#8220;A gracious tongue multiplies courtesies&#8221; (Sir 6:5). Secondly,
it should be considerate; and so he says, seasoned with salt. Salt signifies considerateness or
discretion, because just as salt makes food savory, so every inconsiderate action is bitter and
irregular: &#8220;Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another&#8221; (Mk 9:50). They should
do these things so that you may know how you ought to answer every one. For those who have
wisdom should be answered one way; and the foolish are to be answered in another way:
&#8220;Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him yourself&#8221; (Prov 26:4); &#8220;Always
be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you,&#8221;
as we read in 1 Peter (3:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">189. &#8211; Next, Paul tells them about some others. First, about those whom he is sending to them;
and secondly, about those who are staying with him (v. 10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">190. &#8211; Paul is sending to them a representative, whom he now describes in three ways. First, as
to love, saying, a beloved brother, that is, by the love of charity, which makes a person more
precious than gold: &#8220;A man will be more precious than gold&#8221; (Is 13:12). Secondly, he is
described as to his faith, a faithful minister: &#8220;It is required of stewards that they be found
trustworthy&#8221; (1 Cor 4:2). Thirdly, from his humility; and so Paul says, fellow servant, in the
ministry, but a fellow servant in the Lord, because a prelate should be looking out for the honor
of God and for the benefit of those over whom he has charge. Why is Tychicus being sent? To
learn the condition of the faithful. &#8220;Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the
flock; and bring me word again&#8221; (Gen 37:14); &#8220;See how your brothers fare, and bring some token
from them&#8221; (1 Sam 17:18). He is also to encourage and comfort them: &#8220;For I long to see you, that
I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may be mutually
encouraged by each other&#8217;s faith&#8221; (Rom 1:11). Our Lord, who was sent by the Father, also came
for this purpose: &#8220;to comfort all who mourn&#8221; (Is 61:2). Then he mentions his companion, and
with him Onesimus. These two will tell you of everything that has taken place here; they will
relate what you are doing to me for correction, and tell you what I am doing so you may have an
example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">191. &#8211; Then when he says, Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, he shows how those who
are remaining with the Apostle greet them. The text is clear. And Mark the cousin of Barnabas,
concerning whom you have received instructions. We read in Acts (15:37) that a certain person
by the name of John, surnamed Mark, had left Paul and Barnabas when they set out on one of
their journeys; however, he later returned to them. Barnabas wanted to take him back, but Paul
refused. As a result, Paul and Barnabas went their different ways. Later, Paul wrote to the
Colossians that they were not to receive Mark. But now, since Mark had changed, he asks them
to receive him. Thus, concerning whom you have received instructions: if he comes to you,
receive him. Or, it could be understood this way: And Mark the cousin of Barnabas, concerning
whom, that is, Barnabas, you have received instructions. And Jesus who is called Justus; he was
a holy man, and so was called &#8220;Justus&#8221; [the Just]. These are the only men of the circumcision,
sent to preach the Good News of Christ: &#8220;What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense
or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice&#8221; (Phil 1:18). Thus he mentions the Gentiles
first, and then the Jews. Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, because he was an Asian. Their wish
for the Colossians is &#8220;that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing&#8221; (Jas 1:4); that
you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God, that is, in all things relating to the
will of God. Then he mentions Luke, who it seems, was not Jewish by birth, because he was from
Antioch, and a physician. He singles him out because he had great authority in the Church
because of the Gospel he wrote while the Apostle was still alive. He also mentions Demas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">192. &#8211; Next (v. 15), he mentions those whom the Colossians ought to greet: first, those from
another church, and secondly, those in their own. We can see from what he says, see that you
read also the letter from Laodicea, that Paul wrote other letters: the one to the Laodiceans
mentioned here, and another to the Corinthians, besides the first and second, because in 1
Corinthians (5:9) he says: &#8220;I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with immoral men.&#8221; There
are two reasons why they are not in the canon: either there was some doubt about their authority,
because they were possibly distorted, and had been destroyed in the churches, or because they
contained nothing different from the others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">193. &#8211; And say to Archippus. He was their prelate, and he tells them to warn him: see that you
fulfil the ministry which you have received in the Lord: &#8220;Fulfil your ministry&#8221; (2 Tim 4:5). One
is said to fulfil his ministry when he does that for which he received it. Still, it does not seem
proper for those in a congregation to warn their own prelate (Ex 19:24). I answer that a member
of the congregation is forbidden to rebuke him sharply or insult him, but he can warn him in a
charitable way as Paul rebuked Peter (Gal 2:11). But why did he not write to the prelate? Because
the prelate exists for the Church and not the Church for the prelate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">194. &#8211; I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. It was the Apostle&#8217;s practice to have
someone else write the entire letter, and at the end of it he would write something in his own
hand, as in 2 Thessalonians (3:17): &#8220;I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.&#8221; He does the
same here, so that they will not be deceived. [And he says, Remember my fetters, because he was
fettered in Rome]: &#8220;As an example of suffering and patience, brethren, take the prophets who
spoke in the name of the Lord&#8221; (Jas 5:10); &#8220;Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the
word of God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith&#8221; (Heb 13:7). Then he
wishes them well, concluding: Grace be with you: &#8220;Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ&#8221;
(Jn 1:17), to Whom be praise and glory now and forever. Amen. </p>
