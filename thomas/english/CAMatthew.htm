the Gospel, briefly expressing the loftiness, the name, and the substance of
the Gospel doctrine, addresses the evangelic teacher in the person of the Lord,

contra Faust., ii, 2: The word, �Evangelium,� (Gospel,) is rendered in Latin
�bonus nuntius,� or �bona annuntiatio,� (good news.) It may indeed be used on
all occasions whenever any good is announced; but it has come to be
appropriated to the announcement of the Saviour.</p>

Homil. in Matt., i, 2: For what is there that can equal these good tidings? God
on earth, man in heaven; that long war ceased, reconciliation made between God
and our nature, the devil overthrown, death abolished, paradise opened. These
things, so far beyond our merits, are given us with all fulness; not for our
own toil or labour, but because we are beloved of God.</p>

de vera relig, c. 16: Whereas God in many ways heals the souls of men,
according to the times and the seasons which are ordained by His [p. 2]
marvellous wisdom, yet has He in no way more beneficently provided for the human
race, than when the Very Wisdom of God, the Only Son of one substance and
coeternal with the Father, stooped to take upon Him perfect man, and the Word
was made flesh and dwelt among us. Hereby He made manifest how high a place
among creatures had human nature, in that He appeared to men as Very Man.</p>

Therefore that the Lord should not be supposed to be present in such a way as

Serm. in Nativ., xix, 3: By the unspeakable power of God, it was wrought, that
while very Man was in the inviolable God, and very God is passible flesh, there
was bestowed upon man, glory through shame, immortality through punishment,
life through death.</p>

de Peccatorum Meritis, ii, 30: For blood that was without sin being shed, the
bond of all men�s sins was done away, by which men were before held captive by
the Devil.</p>

Therefore because men, having been delivered from sin by virtue of Christ

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Leo</span>:
In Christ then was given us this wonderful deliverance, that on our passible
nature the condition of death should not abide, which His impassible essence
had admitted, and that by that which could not die, that which was dead might
be brought to life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Gloss</span>.:
And thus through Christ is opened to us the entrance of immortal glory,
concerning which it follows, �Lo, His reward is with Him;� that, namely, of
which Himself speaks, �Your reward is abundant in heaven.� [Matt 5:12]</p>

contra Faust., iv, 2: The promise of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven
belongs to the New Testament; in the Old Testament are contained promises of
temporal things.</p>

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Gloss</span>.:
So then evangelic teaching delivers to us four things [p. 3] concerning Christ;
the Divinity that takes upon it, the Humanity that is taken upon it, His Death
by which we are delivered from bondage, His Resurrection by which the entrance
of a glorious life is opened to us. On this account it is represented in
Ezekiel under the figure of the four animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Gregory</span>,
in Ezek, Hom., iv: The Only-begotten Son of God was Himself verily made Man;
Himself condescended to die as the sacrifice of our redemption as a Calf; He
rose again through the power of His might, as a Lion; and as an Eagle He
ascended aloft into heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Gloss</span>.:
In which ascension He shewed manifestly His Divinity; Matthew then is denoted
by the Man, because he dwells chiefly on the humanity of Christ; Mark by the
Lion, because he treats of His Resurrection; Luke by the Calf, because he
insists on His Priesthood; John by the Eagle, because he describes the
sacraments of His Divinity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Ambrose</span>,
Comm. in Luc., pref.: And it has happened well that we set out with delivering
the opinion that the Gospel according to Matthew is of a moral kind, for morals
are the peculiar province of man. The figure of a Lion is ascribed to Mark,
because he begins with an assertion of His Divine power, saying, �The beginning
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God.� The figure of the Eagle is given
to John, because he has described the miracles of the Divine Resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Greg</span>.:
These things the commencement of each of the Gospel books testifies. Because he
opens with Christ�s human generation, Matthew is rightly designated by a Man;
Mark by a Lion, because he begins with the crying in the desert; Luke by a
Calf, because he begins with a sacrifice; because he takes his beginning from
the divinity of the Word, John is worthily signified by an Eagle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Aug</span>.,
de Consensu Evang., i, 6: Or, Matthew who has chiefly represented the regal
character of Christ, is designated by a Lion; Luke by a Calf, because of the
Priest�s victim; Mark, who chose neither to relate the royal nor the priestly
lineage [ed. note: The original text of <span style='font-family:Arial;
color:blue'>Augustine</span> has here, �neque stirpem regiam neque sacerdotalem
vel consecrationem vel cognationem.�], and yet is clearly busied about His
human nature, is designated by the figure of a Man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>These three animals, the Lion, the Man, the
Calf, walk on the earth, whence these three Evangelists are mostly employed
about those things which Christ wrought in the flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>But John, [p. 4] as the Eagle, soars on
high, and with most keen eyes of the heart beholds the light of unchangeable
Truth. From which we may understand, that the other three Evangelists are
occupied about the active, and John about the contemplative, life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>The Greek Doctors by the Man understood
Matthew, because he has deduced the Lord�s lineage according to the flesh; by
the Lion, John, because as the lion, strikes terror into the other beasts by
his roaring, so John struck terror into all heretics; by the Calf, they
understood Luke, because the calf was the victim of the Priests, and he is much
employed concerning the Temple and the Priesthood; and by the Eagle they
understood Mark, because the eagle in the Divine Scripture is used to denote
the Holy Spirit, who spake by the mouths of the Prophets; and Mark begins with
a citation from the Prophets.</p>

Luke 1, 1: Concerning the number of the Evangelists, it should be known, that
there were many who had written Gospels, as the Evangelist Luke witnesses,
saying, �Forasmuch as many have taken in hand, &amp;c.,� and as books remaining
to the present time declare which divers authors have set forth, therein laying
the foundation of many heresies; such as the Gospel according to the Egyptians,
according to Thomas, Matthias, and Bartholomew [see note, b, just below]; that
of the twelve Apostles, and Basilides, and Apelles, and others whom it would be
long to reckon up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>The Gospel according to the Egyptians is
supposed to be one of the works referred to in the beginning of St. Luke. It
was afterwards used by the Gnostics and Sabellians in their defence. There seem
to have been several Gospels according to Thomas, one ascribed to a disciple of
Manes; one of an earlier date. One is still extant and is one of the two
Gospels of our Saviour�s infancy, which seem to be the work of the Gnostics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>The Gospel according to the Twelve Apostles
seems to be the same as the celebrated Gospel according to the Nazarenes, or
Hebrews, supposed to have been prior to the inspired Gospels, and afterwards
corrupted by the Ebionites. Basilides was a Gnostic, and Apelles a Marcionite.
Little is known of the Gospels according to Matthias, and Bartholomew; the
former seems to have been of Gnostic origin.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>But the Church, which is founded by the
Lord�s word upon the rock, sending forth, like Paradise, its four streams, has
four corners and four rings, by which as the ark of the covenant, and the
guardian of the Law of the Lord, it is carried about on moveable [ed. note:
some read, immobilibus] [p. 5] staves.</p>

de cons. Evan. i. 2: Or, Because there are four quarters of the world, through
the whole of which Christ�s Church is extended. In learning and preaching they
had a different order from that they had in writing. In learning and preaching
they ranked first who followed the Lord present in the flesh, heard Him
teaching, saw Him acting, and by His mouth were sent to preach the Gospel; but
in penning the Gospel, an order which we must suppose to have been fixed by
Heaven, the first place, and the last place were filled out of the number of
those whom the Lord chose before His passion, the first by Matthew, the last by
John; so that the other two, who were not of that number, but who yet followed
Christ speaking in them, were embraced as sons, and placed in the middle
between the other two, so as to be supported by them on both sides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Remigius</span>:
Matthew wrote in Judaea in the time of the Emperor Caius Caligula; Mark in
Italy, at Rome, in the time of Nero or Claudius, according to <span

Achaia and Baeotia, at the request of Theophilus; John at Ephesus, in Asia

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Bede</span>:
But though there were four Evangelists, yet what they wrote is not so much four
Gospels, as one true harmony of four books. For as two verses having the same
substance, but different words and different metre, yet contain one and the
same matter, so the books of the Evangelists, though four in number, yet
contain one Gospel, teaching one doctrine of the Catholic faith.</p>

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Chrys</span>.:
It had indeed been enough that one Evangelist should have written all; but
whereas four speak all things as with one mouth, and that neither from the same
place nor at the same time, nor having met and discoursed together, these
things are the greatest test of truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>It is also a mark of truth that in some
small matters they seem to disagree. For had their agreement been complete
throughout, adversaries might have supposed that it was by a human collusion
that this was brought about. Indeed, in essentials which pertain to direction
of life, and preaching the faith, they do not differ in the least thing. And if
in their accounts of miracles, one tells it in one way, another in another, let
not this disturb you; but think that if one had told all, the other three would
have been a needless superfluity; had they all written different things, there
would have been no [p. 6] room for proof of their harmony. And if their account
differs in times or modes, this does not hinder the truth of the facts themselves
which they relate, as shall be shewn below.</p>

Though each seems to have followed an order of narration of his own, yet we do
not find any one of them writing as if in ignorance of his predecessor, or that
he left out some things which he did not know, which another was to supply; but
as each had inspiration, he gave accordingly the cooperation of his own not
unnecessary labour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;

But the sublimity of the Gospel doctrine consists, first, in its preeminent
authority.</p>

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Aug</span>.:
For among all the Divine instruments which are contained in Holy Writ, the
Gospel has justly the most excellent place; its first preachers were the
Apostles who had seen the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ present in the flesh;
and some of them, that is, Matthew and John, published each a book of such
things as seemed good to be published concerning Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>And that it should not be supposed, that,
as far as relates to receiving and preaching the Gospel, it makes any
difference whether it is announced by those who followed Him during His sojourn
in the flesh, or by those who faithfully believed what they heard from others,
it is provided by Divine Providence through the Holy Spirit [ed. note: a clause
is inserted here from the original to complete the sense.], that a commission, as
well of writing as of preaching the Gospel, should be bestowed on some out of
the number of those that followed the first Apostles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Gloss</span>.:
And thus it is clear that the sublimity of the authority of the Gospel is
derived from Christ; this is proved by the words of the Prophet cited above,
�Go up to the top of the mountain.� For Christ is that Mountain of whom the
same Isaiah speaks, �And there shall be in the last days a mountain prepared,
the house of the Lord in the top of the mountains;� [Isa 2:2] that is, upon all
the saints who from Christ the Mountain are also called mountains; for of His
fulness have we all received. And rightly is that, �Go thou up upon a high
mountain,� addressed to Matthew, who, as had been foretold, in his own person
saw the deeds of Christ, and heard His doctrine.</p>

de cons. Evan. i. 7: This should be considered which to many presents a great
difficulty, why the Lord Himself wrote nothing, so that we are obliged to give
our belief to others who wrote [p. 7] of Him.</p>

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Gloss</span>.:
But we ought not to say that He wrote nothing, seeing His members have written
those things which they learned by the dictation of their Head. For whatever He
would have us to read concerning His actions or His words, that He enjoined
upon them to write as His own hands.</p>

Secondly, the Evangelic doctrine has sublimity of strength; whence the Apostle
says, �The Gospel is the power of God to the salvation of all that believe.�
[Rom 1:16] The Prophet also shews this in the foregoing words, �Lift up thy voice
with might;� which further marks out the manner of evangelic teaching, by that
raising the voice which gives clearness to the doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Aug</span>.,
ad Volus. Ep. 3: For the mode in which Holy Scripture is put together, is one
accessible to all, but thoroughly entered into by few. The things it shews
openly, it doth as a familiar friend without guile speaking to the heart of the
unlearned, as the learned. The things it veils in mysteries, it does not deck
out in lofty speech, to which a slow and unlearned soul would not dare to
approach, as a poor man would not to a rich; but in lowly phrase it invites
all, whom it not only feeds with plain truth, but exercises in hidden
knowledge; for it has matter of both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>But that its plain things might not be
despised, these very same things it again withholds; being withheld they become
as new; and thus become new they are again pleasingly expressed. Thus all
tempers have here what is meet for them; the bad are corrected, the weak are
strengthened, the strong are gratified.</p>

many more things of the like kind.</p>

Word were of one and the same substance, most perversely insisting on that

nature, as though the Divine Word had changed itself into flesh and soul, and
as though the conception, birth, growth, and such like, had been undergone by
that Divine Essence, which was incapable of any such changes with the very and

falls into the insane notions of Manichaeus and Marcion, and believes that the
Lord Jesus Christ did all His actions with a false appearance, that His body

How Booz took to wife a Moabitess whose name was Ruth, I thought it needless to
tell, seeing the Scripture concerning them is open to all. We need but say thus
much, that Ruth married Booz for the reward of her faith, for that she had cast
off the gods of her forefathers, and had chosen the living God. And Booz
received her to wife for reward of his faith, that from such sanctified wedlock
might be descended a kingly race.</p>

not reckoned among the Kings in the genealogy, because God�s people had not set
him on the throne, but Pharoah by his might. For if it were just that only for
their intermixture with the race of Ahab, three kings should be shut out of the
number in the genealogy, was it not just that Joakim should be likewise shut
out, whom Pharaoh had set up as king by hostile force? And thus Jechonias, who
is the son of Joakim, and the grandson of Josiah, is reckoned among the kings
as the son of Josiah, in place of his father who is omitted.</p>

Otherwise, we may consider the first Jeconias to be the same as Joakim, and the
second to be the son not the father, the one being spelt with k and m, the
second by ch and n. This distinction has been confounded both by Greeks and
Latins, by the fault of writers and the lapse of time.</p>

in Luc., cap. 2: That there were two kings of the name of Joakim, is clear from
the Book of Kings. �And Joakim slept with his fathers, and Joachim his son
reigned in his stead.� [2 Ki 24:6] This son is the same whom Jeremiah calls
Jeconias. And rightly did St. Matthew purpose to differ from the Prophet, because
he sought to shew therein the great abundance of the Lord�s mercies. For the
Lord did not seek among men nobility of race, but suitably chose to be born of
captives and of sinners, as He came to preach remission of sin to the captives.
The Evangelist therefore did not conceal either of these; but rather shewed
them both, inasmuch as both were called Jeconias.</p>

But it may be asked, why the Evangelist says they were born in the carrying
away, when they were born before the carrying away. He says this because they
were born for this purpose, that they should be led captive, from the dominion
of the whole nation, for their own and others� sins. And because God foreknew
that they were [p. 28] to be carried away captive, therefore he says, they were
born in the carrying away to Babylon.</p>

This passage is objected to us by the Emperor Julian in his Discrepancy of the

Heli. He did not know the Scripture manner, one was his father by nature, the

near kinsman died without children, another should take his wife, to raise up
seed to his brother or kinsman. [Deut 25]</p>

by one and the same wife Jesca. Matthan, who traced through Solomon, first had
her, and died leaving one son, Jacob by name. As the Law forbade not a widow,
either dismissed from her husband, or after the death of her husband, to be
married to another, so Melchi, who traced through Matthan, being of the same
tribe but of another race, took this widow to his wife, and begat Heli his son.</p>

The attentive reader may ask, Seeing Joseph was not the father of the Lord and

same tribe, and that he was thence compelled to take her to wife as a kinsman,
and they were enrolled together at Bethlehem, as being come of one stock.</p>

motion gives life to all seeds, so as that itself is not mixed up with the

matter to its own uses, it makes one with itself the person of that thing which

say, is said to be born of His mother, who shaped to Himself a body out of her,
in which He might be born; not as though before He was born, His mother might,
as far as pertained to Him, not have been in being. In like manner, yea in a
manner yet more incomprehensible and sublime, the Son of God was born, by
taking on Him perfect manhood of his Mother. He [p. 37] who by his singular
almighty power is the cause of their being born to all things that are born.</p>

There were three reasons why the Angel appeared to Joseph with this message.
First, that a just man might not be led into an unjust action, with just
intentions. Secondly, for the honour of the mother herself, for had she been
put away, she could not have been free from evil suspicion among the
unbelievers. Thirdly, that Joseph, understanding the holy conception, might
keep himself from her with more care than before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>He did not appear to Joseph before the conception,
that he should not think those things that Zacharias thought, nor suffer what
he suffered in falling into the sin of unbelief concerning the conception of
his wife in her old age. For it was yet more incredible that a virgin should
conceive, than that a woman past the age should conceive.</p>

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Chrys</span>.:
Or, The Angel appeared to Joseph when he was in this perplexity, that his
wisdom might be apparent to Joseph, and that this [p. 49] might be a proof to
him of those things that he spoke. For when he heard out of the mouth of the
Angel those very things that he thought within himself, this was an undoubted
proof, that he was a messenger from God, who alone knows the secrets of the
heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>Also the account of the Evangelist is
beyond suspicion, as he describes Joseph feeling all that a husband was likely
to feel. The Virgin also by this was more removed from suspicion, in that her
husband had felt jealousy, yet took her home, and kept her with him after her
conception. She had not told Joseph the things that the Angel had said to her,
because she did not suppose that she should be believed by her husband,
especially as he had begun to have suspicions concerning her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>But to the Virgin the Angel announced her
conception before it took place, lest if he should defer it till afterwards she
should be in straits. And it behoved that Mother who was to receive the Maker
of all things to be kept free from all trouble. Not only does the Angel
vindicate the Virgin from all impurity, but shews that the conception was supernatural,
not removing his fears only, but adding matter of joy; saying, �That which is
born in her is of the Holy Spirit.�</p>

ord: To be �born in her,� and �born of her,� are two different things; to be
born of her is to come into the world; to be born in her, is the same as to be
conceived. Or the word, �born,� is used according to the foreknowledge of the
Angel which he has of God, to whom the future is as the past.</p>

said, �Wisdom hath built herself an house?� [Prov 9:1]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>That house may be taken in two meanings.
First, the house of Christ is the Church, which He built with His own blood;
and secondly, His body may be called His house, as it is called His temple. But
the work of the Holy Spirit, is also the work of the Son of God, because of the
unity of their nature and their will; for whether it be the Father, or the Son,
or the Holy Spirit, that doeth it, it is the Trinity that works, and what the
Three do, is of One God.</p>

it. [p. 50]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>How then do we say that Christ was born by
the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Spirit did not beget Him? Did He create Him? For
so far as He is man He was created, as the Apostle speaks; �He was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh.� [Rom 1:3] For though God made the world,
yet is it not right to say that it is the Son of God, or born by Him, but that
it was made, or created, or formed by Him. But seeing that we confess Christ to
have been born by the Holy Spirit, and of the Virgin Mary, how is He not the
Son of the Holy Spirit, and is the Son of the Virgin? It does not follow, that
whatever is born by any thing, is therefore to be called the son of that thing;
for, not to say that of man is born in one sense a son, in another a hair, or
vermin, or a worm, none of which are his son, certainly those that are born of
water and the Spirit none would call sons of water; but sons of God their
Father, and their Mother the Church. Thus Christ was born of the Holy Spirit,
and yet is the Son of God the Father, not of the Holy Spirit.</p>

ap Anselm: That Joseph should not suppose that he was no longer needed in this
wedlock, seeing the conception had taken place without his intervention, the
Angel declares to him, that though there had been no need of him in the
conception, yet there was need of his guardianship; for the Virgin should bear
a Son, and then he would be necessary both to the Mother and her Son; to the
Mother to screen her from disgrace, to the Son to bring Him up and to
circumcise Him. The circumcision is meant when he says, �And thou shalt call
His name Jesus;� for it was usual to give the name in circumcision.</p>

This further shews that this birth should be wonderful, because it is God that
sends down His name from above by His Angel; and that not any name, but one
which is a treasure of infinite good. Therefore also the Angel interprets it,

we lean more easily to prosperous things, and yield our belief more readily to

conceive and should bring forth would never have been fulfilled, had she not
been espoused that she should not be stoned; and had not her secret been
disclosed by the Angel, and so Joseph taken her unto him, that she was not
dismissed to disgrace and to perish by stoning. So had she perished before the
birth, that prophecy would have been made void which says, �She shall bring
forth a Son.� [Isa 7:14]</p>

Or it may be said, that the word �that� does not here denote the cause; for the
prophecy was not fulfilled merely because it was to be fulfilled. But it is put
consecutively, as in Genesis, �He hung the other on the gallows, that the truth
of the interpreter might be proved;� [Gen 40:22] since by the weighing of one,
truth is established. So also in this place we must understand it as if it

Otherwise; the Angel seeing the depths of the Divine mercy, the laws of nature
broken through and reconciliation made, He who was above all made lower than
all; all these wonders, all this he comprises in that one saying, �Now all this
hath happened;� as though he had said, Do not suppose that this is newly
devised of God, it was determined of old. And he rightly cites the Prophet not
to the Virgin, who as a maiden was untaught in such things, but to Joseph, as

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;

with Halma used of a married woman, but of her that is a virgin, and such that
she be not merely a virgin, but in the age of youth; for it is possible for an

It is a question who interpreted this name? The Prophet, or the Evangelist, or
some translator? It should be known then, that the Prophet did not interpret
it; and what need had the Holy Evangelist to do so, seeing he wrote in the

therefore needed interpretation. It is more probable that some translator
interpreted it, that the Latins might not be perplexed by an unintelligible

It should be known, that the Hebrews believe this prophecy to refer to Ezekias,
the son of Ahaz, because in his reign Samaria was taken; but this cannot be
established. Ahaz [p. 55] son of Jotham reigned over Judaea and Jerusalem
sixteen years, and was succeeded by his son Ezekias, who was twenty-three years
old, and reigned over Judaea and Jerusalem twenty-nine years; how then can a
prophecy prophesied in the first year of Ahaz refer to the conception and birth
of Ezekias, when he was already nine years of age? Unless perhaps the sixth
year of the reign of Ezekias, in which Samaria was taken, they think is here
called his infancy, that is, the infancy of his reign, not of his age; which

will make it appear that you have God present with you. But after He shall be
called Jesus, that is, Saviour, because He shall save the whole human race.
Wonder not, therefore, O house of David, at the newness of this thing, that a

Should he refuse assent to this, we establish their credit from their having

formerly suffered from the Kings of this world; let him now behold those very

�know� refer to carnal knowledge rather than to acquaintance, as though any had
ever denied that; or as if the follies to which he replies had ever occurred to
any person of common understanding. He then goes on to say, that the adverb,
�until,� denotes a fixed time when that should take place, which had not taken
place before; so that here from the words, �He knew her not until she had
brought forth her first-born Son,� it is clear, he says, that after that he did
know her. And in proof of this he heaps together many instances from Scripture.</p>

that, �The child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and His parents knew not of

when they are grown old? Also the Saviour in the Gospel, �Lo, I am with you
always, even to the end of this world.� [Matt 28:20] Will He then leave His

Supposing an Evangelist thought the very notion shocking that Joseph should
have considered the Blessed Virgin as his wife after he was a witness of her
bearing God the Son, he would only say that the vision had its effect upon him

but after that he understood how she had been made a temple of the
Only-begotten of God, how could he occupy that? The followers of Eunomius
think, as they have dared to assert this, that Joseph also dared to do it, just

to dare to touch his wife, would he, after he had heard the shepherds, seen the

Append. Serm. 132: Many kings of Judaea had been born and died before, yet had
Magi ever sought out any of them for adoration? No, for they had not been
taught that any of these spoke from heaven. To no ordinary King of Judaea had
these men, aliens from the land of Judaea, ever thought such honour due. But
they had been taught that this Child was one, in worshipping whom they would
certainly secure that salvation which is of God. Neither His age was such as attracts
men�s flattery; His limbs not robed in purple, His brow not crowned with a
diamond, no pompous train, no awful army, no glorious fame of battles,
attracted these men to Him from the remotest countries, with such earnestness
of supplication. There lay in a manger a Boy, newly born, of infantine size, of
pitiable poverty. But in that small Infant lay hid something great, which these
men, the first-fruits of the Gentiles, had learned not of earth but of heaven;
as it follows, �We have seen His star in the east.� They announce the vision
and ask, they believe and enquire, as signifying those who walk by faith and

City of God, book v, ch. 1: For by the word, �fate,� in common acceptation, is meant
the disposition of the stars at the moment of a person�s birth or conception;
to which some assign a power independent of the will of God. These must be kept
at a distance from the ears of all who desire to be worshippers of Gods of any
sort. But others think the stars have this virtue committed to them by the
great God; wherein they greatly wrong the skies, in that they impute to their
splendent host the decreeing of crimes, such as should any earthly people
decree, their city should in the judgment of mankind deserve to be utterly
destroyed.</p>

Providence is banished from the world together with piety, and man is made the

teach this, take away all that is in us, and the very nature of a contingency;
which is nothing less than to overturn all things. For where will there be free

it is by the approach and departure of the sun that the seasons of the year are
[p. 65] varied, and that many things, as shells and the wonderful tides of the
Ocean, increase or decrease as the moon waxes or wanes. But not so, to say that
the dispositions of the mind are subject to sidereal impulse. Do they say that
the stars rather foreshew than effect these results? how then do they explain,
that in the life of twins, in their actions, their successes, professions,
honours, and all other circumstances of life, there will often be so great
diversity, that men of different countries are often more alike in their lives

cont. Faust. ii, 5: But if we will not subject the nativity of any man to the
influence of the stars, in order that we may vindicate the freedom of the will
from any chain of necessity; how much less must we suppose sidereal influences
to have ruled at His temporal birth, who is eternal Creator and Lord of the
universe? The star which the Magi saw, at Christ�s birth according to the
flesh, did not rule His fate, but ministered as a testimony to Him. Further,
this was not of the number of those stars, which from the beginning of the
creation observe their paths of motion according to the law of their Maker; but
a star that first appeared at the birth, ministering to the Magi who sought
Christ, by going before them till it brought them to the place where the infant
God the Word was.</p>

not therefore born because it arose, but the reverse; so that if we must have
fate connected with the stars, this star did not rule Christ�s fate, but Christ
the stars.</p>

De Con. Evan. ii. 10: Here is may be asked, How then could his parents go up

Archelaus now prevented them from approaching it? This difficulty is easily
solved. At the festival they might escape notice in the crowd, and by returning
soon, where in ordinary times they might be afraid to live. So they neither
became irreligious by neglecting the festival, nor notorious by dwelling
continually in Jerusalem.</p>

tetrarch, as Luke tells us? As if the times of which Luke is speaking were
times in which there was any longer need to fear for the Child, when even in
Judaea things were so changed, that Archelaus no longer ruled there, but Pilate
was governor.</p>

when it should seem most probable that they chose Galilee because Nazareth was
[p. 89] their own city, as Luke has not forgot to mention. We must understand,
that when the Angel in the vision in Egypt said to Joseph, �Go into the land of
Israel,� Joseph understood the command to be that he should go straight into
Judaea, that being properly �the land of Israel.� But finding Archelaus ruling there,
he would not court the danger, as �the land of Israel� might be interpreted to
extend to Galilee, which was inhabited by children of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;

Apostles, to whom Christ is entrusted to be borne about. These, as though Herod
were dead, that is, his people being destroyed in the Lord�s passion, are
commanded to preach the Gospel to the Jews; they are sent to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel. But finding the seed of their hereditary unbelief still
abiding, they fear and withdraw; admonished by a vision, to wit, seeing the
Holy Ghost poured upon the Gentiles, they carry Christ to them.</p>

Or, we may apply it to the last times of the Jewish Church, when many Jews
having turned to the preaching of Enoch and Elijah, the rest filled with the
spirit of Antichrist shall fight against the faith. So that part of Judaea
where Archelaus rules, signifies the followers of Antichrist; Nazareth of
Galilee, whither Christ is conveyed, that part of the nation that shall embrace
the faith. Galilee means, �removal;� Nazareth, �the flower of virtues;� for the
Church the more zealously she removes from the earthly to the heavenly, the

is of no importance [p. 94] that he says, �This is he,� and not, �I am he;� for
Matthew speaking of himself says, �He found a man sitting at the toll-office;�

fearing God. And perfect fear takes away all shame. But there is seen the shame
of confession where there is no fear of the judgment to come. But as shame
itself is a heavy punishment, God therefore bids us confess our sins that we
may suffer this shame as punishment; for that itself is a part of the judgment.</p>

As a skilful physician from the colour of the skin infers the sick man�s
disease, so John understood the evil thoughts of the Pharisees who came to him.
They thought perhaps, We go, and confess our sins; he imposes no burden on us,
we will be baptized, and get indulgence for sin. Fools! if ye have eaten of
impurity, must ye not needs take physic? So after confession and baptism, a man
needs much diligence to heal the wound of sin; therefore he says, �Generation
of vipers.�</p>

dies; so this �progeny of vipers,� after having committed deadly sin, ran to
baptism, that, like vipers, they might escape death by means of water.</p>

There is this difference between the chaff and the tares, in that the chaff is
produced of the same seed as the wheat, but the tares from one of another kind.

de Cons. Evan., ii. 12: If any asks which were the actual words spoken by John,
whether those reported by Matthew, or by Luke, or by [p. 107] Mark, it may be
shewn, that there is no difficulty here to him who rightly understands that the
sense is essential to our knowledge of the truth, but the words indifferent.
And it is clear we ought not to deem any testimony false, because the same fact
is related by several persons who were present in different words and different
ways.</p>

have been so inspired by the Holy Ghost that they should have differed among
themselves neither in the choice, nor the number, nor the order of their words,
he does not see that by how much the authority of the Evangelists is
preeminent, so much the more is to be by them established the veracity of other
men in the same circumstances. But the discrepancy may seem to be in the thing,
and not only in words, between, �I am not worthy to bear His shoes,� and �to
loose His shoe-latchet.� Which of these two expressions did John use? He who
has reported the very words will seem to have spoken truth; he who has given
other words, though he have not hid, or been forgetful, yet had he said one
thing for another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>But the Evangelists should be clear of
every kind of falseness, not only that of lying, but also that of
forgetfulness. If then this discrepancy be important, we may suppose John to
have used both expressions, either at different times, or both at the same
time. But if he only meant to express the Lord�s greatness and his own humility,
whether he used one or the other the sense is preserved, though any one should
in his own words repeat the same profession of humility using the figure of the
shoes; their will and intention does not differ.</p>

that we are to enquire only after the meaning of the speaker.</p>
