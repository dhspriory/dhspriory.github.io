<ol><B>BOOK I: THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL THINGS: Lectures</B>
<li><a href="Physics1.htm">The matter and the subject of natural science</a>
<li><a href="Physics1.htm#2">The opinions of the ancient philosophers about the principles of nature and of beings</a>
<li><a href="Physics1.htm#3">The assertion of Parmenides and Melissus that all things are one being</a>
<li><a href="Physics1.htm#4">Later philosophers' same error: that the one and the many could not in any way concur</a>

<li><a href="Physics7.htm#3">In local motion, mover and moved must be together</a>
<li><a href="Physics7.htm#4">It is shown in alteration, and growth and decrease, that mover and moved are together</a>

<li><a href="Physics8.htm#9">No process to infinity in movers. Not every mover need be moved</a>
<li><a href="Physics8.htm#10">In that which moves itself, one part moves and the other is moved</a>
<li><a href="Physics8.htm#11">How the parts of something moving itself are related</a>
<li><a href="Physics8.htm#12">The first mover is not moved, but is one and perpetual</a>
<li><a href="Physics8.htm#13">The first mover is perpetual and wholly unmoved, as shown from moving principles</a>
<li><a href="Physics8.htm#14">Many reasons why local motion is the first motion</a>
