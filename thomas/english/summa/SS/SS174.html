<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the division of prophecy, and under this head there 
are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ174A1THEP1">(1)</a> The division of prophecy into its species;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ174A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the more excellent prophecy is that which is without 
imaginative vision?<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prophecy is fittingly divided into the prophecy of divine predestination, of foreknowledge, and of denunciation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prophecy is unfittingly divided according to a 
gloss on Mt. 1:23, "Behold a virgin shall be with child," where it is 
stated that "one kind of prophecy proceeds from the Divine 
predestination, and must in all respects be accomplished so that its 
fulfillment is independent of our will, for instance the one in question. 
Another prophecy proceeds from God's foreknowledge: and into this our 
will enters. And another prophecy is called denunciation, which is 
significative of God's disapproval." For that which results from every 
prophecy should not be reckoned a part of prophecy. Now all prophecy is 
according to the Divine foreknowledge, since the prophets "read in the 
book of foreknowledge," as a gloss says on Is. 38:1. Therefore it would 
seem that prophecy according to foreknowledge should not be reckoned a 
species of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as something is foretold in denunciation, so is 
something foretold in promise, and both of these are subject to 
alteration. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++18:7,8">Jer. 18:7,8</a>): "I will suddenly speak 
against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, 
and to destroy it. If that nation against which I have spoken shall 
repent of their evil, I also will repent"---and this pertains to the 
prophecy of denunciation, and afterwards the text continues in reference 
to the prophecy of promise (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++18:9,10">Jer. 18:9,10</a>): "I will suddenly speak of a 
nation and of a kingdom, to build up and plant it. If it shall do evil in 
My sight . . . I will repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto 
it." Therefore as there is reckoned to be a prophecy of denunciation, so 
should there be a prophecy of promise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. vii, 8): "There are seven kinds of 
prophecy. The first is an ecstasy, which is the transport of the mind: 
thus Peter saw a vessel descending from heaven with all manner of beasts 
therein. The second kind is a vision, as we read in Isaias, who says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++6:1">Is. 6:1</a>): 'I saw the Lord sitting,' etc. The third kind is a dream: thus 
Jacob in a dream, saw a ladder. The  fourth kind is from the midst of a 
cloud: thus God spake to Moses. The fifth kind is a voice from heaven, as 
that which called to Abraham saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++22:11">Gn. 22:11</a>): 'Lay not thy hand upon 
the boy.' The sixth kind is taking up a parable, as in the example of 
Balaam (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++23:7;+24:15">Num. 23:7; 24:15</a>). The seventh kind is the fullness of the Holy 
Ghost, as in the case of nearly all the prophets." Further, he mentions 
three kinds of vision; "one by the eyes of the body, another by the 
soul's imagination, a third by the eyes of the mind." Now these are not 
included in the aforesaid division. Therefore it is insufficient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Jerome to whom the gloss above 
quoted is ascribed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The species of moral habits and acts are distinguished 
according to their objects. Now the object of prophecy is something known 
by God and surpassing the faculty of man. Wherefore, according to the 
difference of such things, prophecy is divided into various species, as 
assigned above. Now it has been stated above (<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2) that the 
future is contained in the Divine knowledge in two ways. First, as in its 
cause: and thus we have the prophecy of "denunciation," which is not 
always fulfilled. but it foretells the relation of cause to effect, which 
is sometimes hindered by some other occurrence supervening. Secondly, God 
foreknows certain things in themselves---either as to be accomplished by 
Himself, and of such things is the prophecy of "predestination," since, 
according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 30), "God predestines things 
which are not in our power"---or as to be accomplished through man's 
free-will, and of such is the prophecy of "foreknowledge." This may 
regard either good or evil, which does not apply to the prophecy of 
predestination, since the latter regards good alone. And since 
predestination is comprised under foreknowledge, the gloss in the 
beginning of the Psalter assigns only two species to prophecy, namely of 
"foreknowledge," and of "denunciation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Foreknowledge, properly speaking, denotes precognition of 
future events in themselves, and in this sense it is reckoned a species 
of prophecy. But in so far as it is used in connection with future 
events, whether as in themselves, or as in their causes, it is common to 
every species of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The prophecy of promise is included in the prophecy of 
denunciation, because the aspect of truth is the same in both. But it is 
denominated in preference from denunciation, because God is more inclined 
to remit punishment than to withdraw promised blessings.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Isidore divides prophecy according to the manner of 
prophesying. Now we may distinguish the manner of prophesying---either 
according to man's cognitive powers, which are sense, imagination, and 
intellect, and then we have the three kinds of vision mentioned both by 
him and by Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7)---or according to the 
different ways in which the prophetic  current is received. Thus as 
regards the enlightening of the intellect there is the "fullness of the 
Holy Ghost" which he mentions in the seventh place. As to the imprinting 
of pictures on the imagination he mentions three, namely "dreams," to 
which he gives the third place; "vision," which occurs to the prophet 
while awake and regards any kind of ordinary object, and this he puts in 
the second place; and "ecstasy," which results from the mind being 
uplifted to certain lofty things, and to this he assigns the first place. 
As regards sensible signs he reckons three kinds of prophecy, because a 
sensible sign is---either a corporeal thing offered externally to the 
sight, such as "a cloud," which he mentions in the fourth place---or a 
"voice" sounding from without and conveyed to man's hearing---this he 
puts in the fifth place---or a voice proceeding from a man, conveying 
something under a similitude, and this pertains to the "parable" to which 
he assigns the sixth place.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the prophecy which is accompanied by intellective and imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by intellective vision alone?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophecy which has intellective and 
imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by 
intellective vision alone. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9): "He 
is less a prophet, who sees in spirit nothing but the signs 
representative of things, by means of the images of things corporeal: he 
is more a prophet, who is merely endowed with the understanding of these 
signs; but most of all is he a prophet, who excels in both ways," and 
this refers to the prophet who has intellective together with imaginative 
vision. Therefore this kind of prophecy is more excellent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater a thing's power is, the greater the distance 
to which it extends. Now the prophetic light pertains chiefly to the 
mind, as stated above (<A Href="SS173.html#SSQ173OUTP1">Question [173]</a>, <A Href="SS173.html#SSQ173A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore apparently the prophecy 
that extends to the imagination is greater than that which is confined to 
the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Jerome (Prol. in Lib. Reg.) distinguishes the "prophets" 
from the "sacred writers." Now all those whom he calls prophets (such as 
Isaias, Jeremias, and the like) had intellective together with 
imaginative vision: but not those whom he calls sacred writers, as 
writing by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost (such as Job, David, 
Solomon, and the like). Therefore it would seem more proper to call 
prophets those who had intellective together with imaginative vision, 
than those who had intellective vision alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i) that "it is impossible 
for the Divine ray to shine on us, except as screened round about by the 
many-colored sacred veils." Now the prophetic revelation is conveyed by 
the infusion of the divine ray. Therefore it seems that it cannot be 
without the veils of phantasms. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss says at the beginning of the Psalter that "the 
most excellent manner of prophecy is when a man prophesies by the mere 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, apart from any outward assistance of deed, 
word, vision, or dream."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The excellence of the means is measured chiefly by the 
end. Now the end of prophecy is the manifestation of a truth that 
surpasses the faculty of man. Wherefore the more effective this 
manifestation is, the more excellent the prophecy. But it is evident that 
the manifestation of divine truth by means of the bare contemplation of 
the truth itself, is more effective than that which is conveyed under the 
similitude of corporeal things, for it approaches nearer to the heavenly 
vision whereby the truth is seen in God's essence. Hence it follows that 
the prophecy whereby a supernatural truth is seen by intellectual vision, 
is more excellent than that in which a supernatural truth is manifested 
by means of the similitudes of corporeal things in the vision of the 
imagination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover the prophet's mind is shown thereby to be more lofty: even as 
in human teaching the hearer, who is able to grasp the bare intelligible 
truth the master propounds, is shown to have a better understanding than 
one who needs to be taken by the hand and helped by means of examples 
taken from objects of sense. Hence it is said in commendation of David's 
prophecy (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Sam++23:3">2 Kgs. 23:3</a>): "The strong one of Israel spoke to me," and 
further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Sam++23:4">2 Kgs. 23:4</a>): "As the light of the morning, when the sun 
riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a particular supernatural truth has to be revealed by 
means of corporeal images, he that has both, namely the intellectual 
light and the imaginary vision, is more a prophet than he that has only 
one, because his prophecy is more perfect; and it is in this sense that 
Augustine speaks as quoted above. Nevertheless the prophecy in which the 
bare intelligible truth is revealed is greater than all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same judgment does not apply to things that are sought 
for their own sake, as to things sought for the sake of something else. 
For in things sought for their own sake, the agent's power is the more 
effective according as it extends to more numerous and more remote 
objects; even so a physician is thought more of, if he is able to heal 
more people, and those who are further removed from health. on the other 
hand, in things sought only for the sake of something else, that agent 
would seem to have greater power, who is able to achieve his purpose with 
fewer means and those nearest to hand: thus more praise is awarded the 
physician who is able to heal a sick person by means of fewer and more 
gentle remedies. Now, in the prophetic knowledge, imaginary vision is 
required, not for its own sake, but on account of the manifestation of 
the intelligible truth. Wherefore prophecy is all the m
