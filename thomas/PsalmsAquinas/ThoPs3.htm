<td style=text-align:justify><b><I>Cum fugeret a facie Absalon filii eius. Psalmus David  III.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>A  psalm of David when he was fleeing from the face of his son  Absalon.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>a.  Domine quid multiplicati sunt qui tribulant me? multi insurgunt adversum  me. Multi dicunt animae meae, non est salus ipsi in Deo eius.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>Why,  O Lord, have those who afflict me increased in number? Many rise up  against me. Many say to my soul, There is no salvation for him in his  God.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>b.  Tu autem Domine susceptor meus es, gloria mea, et exaltans caput  meum.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>But  you, O Lord, are my protector, my glory and the one who lifts up my  head.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>c.  Voce mea ad Dominum clamavi, et exaudivit me de monte sancto suo. Ego  dormivi et soporatus sum, et exurrexi, quia Dominus suscepit me.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>I  have cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me from his holy  mountain. I have slept and deeply; and I have risen up because the Lord  has protected me.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>d.  Non timebo millia populi circumdantis me, exurge Domine, salvum me fac  Deus meus. Quoniam tu percussisti omnes adversantes mihi sine causa:  dentes peccatorum contrivisti.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>I  will not fear the thousands of people surounding me: arise, O Lord, make  me safe, O my God. For you have struck all those opposing me without  cause, and have broken the teeth of sinners.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>e.  Domini est salus, et super populum tuum benedictio tua.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>Salvation is of the Lord, and your blessing is upon your  people.

<td style=text-align:justify><B>a.</B> Superior Psalmus ostendit conatum adversariorum, hic contra  eorum conatum implorat auxilium divinum. Et est hic psalmus editus per  modum orationis.
<td style=text-align:justify>The  former psalm showed the effort of his adversaries. Here, he implores  divine help against their effort. And this psalm is presented in the mode  of a prayer.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>In  quo psalmo possumus ponere fundamentum historiae, et postea ponere sensum  allegoricum, et ulterius moralem.
<td style=text-align:justify>We  can describe it first as based in history, second in an allegorical sense,  and lastly in a moral sense.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sensus historicus patet per titulum qui est, <I>Cum fugeret a facie  Absalon filii sui.</I> Ut <I>2. Reg. 5. </I>habetur Absalon filius David  persequens patrem suum quaerebat eum occidere; cui David cessit cum suis  exiens de Hierusalem nudis plantis.
<td style=text-align:justify>The  historical sense is clear from its title which is <I>When he was fleeing  from the face of his son Absalon,</I> as is treated of at <I>2 Kings 15  -</I> David's son, Absalon, persecuting his father, desired to kill him.  David yielded to him, leaving Jerusalem on foot with his  household.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Intellexit hoc sibi contingere propter peccatum homicidii et adulterii,  sicut Nathan propheta ei praedixerat: <I>2. Reg. 12. Non recedet gladius  de domo tua in sempiternum, eo quod despexeris me.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>He  understood that this would happen to him on account of the sins of murder  and adultery, as the Prophet Nathan had foretold to him: <I>2 Kings 12:  The sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised  me.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dum  autem Absalon persequeretur David, conversus est contra eum exercitus  David; Absalon autem impetu muli ductus est sub ramosam quercum, ubi  circumnectentibus ramis collum eius, ibique capite intercepto pendens a  Ioab principe militiae David, interfectus est. Quo mortuo David restituto  in regnum in pace regnavit.
<td style=text-align:justify>When  Absalon was persecuting David, he turned David's army against him.  However, in the assault, Absalon drove his mule under the boughs of an oak  tree, where he was captured, hanging by his head, his kneck having been  enveloped by the boughs. He was killed by Joab, a leader of David's  militia. On account of this death, David was restored to his kingship and  reigned in peace.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Contra istam ergo persecutionem est iste psalmus, <I>Domine quid</I>  etc. Per hanc tamen praefigurabatur persecutio quam Christus passus est a  filio suo Iuda: <I>Io. 13. Filioli adhuc modicum vobiscum sum. </I>Et  interum <I>Matth. 9. Nunquid possunt filii sponsi lugere</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Therefore, this psalm, <I>Why, O Lord,</I> is against this very  persecution. Through it, however, was prefigured the persecution which  Christ suffered from his child Judas - <I>John 13: Little children, yet a  little while I am with you.</I> And again at <I>Matthew 9: Can the  children of the bridegroom mourn</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>A  quo Iuda Christus fugit, quando illo discendente cum caeteris apostolis in  montem Oliveti secessit imminente passione.
<td style=text-align:justify>Christ fled from Judas when he withdrew from his approaching passion by  departing with the rest of the apostles to the mountain of  Olivet.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  sicut David pacem exhibuit iniquo filio, quando praecepit populo eunti ad  bellum, <I>Servate puerum Absalon, </I>et eo interempto dixit, <I>Quis  mihi det, ut moriar pro te fili mi Absalon</I> etc., ita Christus Iudae  proditori, ut patet in convivio et in osculo, propter quod bene Absalon  pax patris dicitur. Abba enim hebraice, latine pater interpretatur. Salon  vero pax.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  just as David offered peace to his wicked son, when he admonished the  people going to war, <I>Save the boy Absalon,</I> and said when he was  killed, <I>Would he grant to me that I might die for you, O my son  Absalon</I> etc., so too did Christ offer peace to Judas the betrayer, as  is clear at the supper and in his kiss. On account of this, Absalon is  well called the peace of the father. For <I>Abba,</I> in hebrew, is  translated by <I>father</I> in latin, and <I>Salon,</I> by <I>peace.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  ipse Iudas cum prolatione pacis prodidit Christum. Et sicut Absalon, ita  et Iudas suspensus interiit.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  Judas himself betrayed Christ with an extension of peace. And as Absalon,  so too did Judas die suspended.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Quo  mortuo Christus in pace regnavit, quia in gloria resurrexit. Et potest ad  omnes tribulationes ecclesiae referri. Potest et moraliter contra  tribulationes, quas quis ab inimicis sive temporalibus sive spiritualibus  patitur. Et ideo exprimitur affectus hominis implorantis.
<td style=text-align:justify>On  account of death, Christ reigned in peace, because he rose in glory. And  this can be referred to all the tribulations of the Church, and it can be  referred morally against the tribulations which it suffers either from  temporal or spiritual enemies. And for this reason, the desire of the  imploring man is expressed.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Circa hoc ergo duo facit. Primo praemittit adversariorum conatum, sive  exponit Deo suum tormentum. Secundo confitetur adesse sibi divinum  auxilium, <I>Tu autem Domine</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Therefore concerning this the psalmist does two things. First he puts  forward the effort of his adversaries, or explains his anguish to God, and  second, acknowledges that divine help goes to him, at, <I>But you O  Lord</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Persecutionem autem ponit, quantum ad nocentium numerum, <I>Multiplicati  sunt,</I> scilicet gentes, populi, reges, et principes. Et non solum hi  extranei, sed etiam filius: <I>Ps. 36. Multiplicatae sunt super caput  meum</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>He  describes his persecution with respect to the number of those doing harm,  <I>they have increased,</I> namely the Gentiles, the people, kings and  princes. And not only these outsiders, but his son as well - <I>Psalm 39:  They are multiplied above my head</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  quantum ad nocendum, motivum, quia sine causa. Unde quid <I>2 Reg. 10 et  26. Quid feci, aut quod est in manu mea malum?</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>With  respect to the harming, the motive, because it is without cause. Thus,  what is written at <I>(?): What have I done, or what evil is in my  hand?</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  quantum ad multiplex tormentum, quia vexant multipliciter tribulando. Unde  <I>Tribulant.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>With  respect to the manifold torment, because they injure by afflicting him in  many ways. Thus, <I>they afflict.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Tribulus est erba pungitiva: <I>Ge. 3. Spinas et tribulos germinabit  tibi.</I> Illi igitur tribulant, qui pungunt.
<td style=text-align:justify>A  thistle is a stinging herb - <I>Genesis 3: Thorns and thistles shall the  earth bring forth to you.</I> Therefore, those afflict who  sting.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Christum autem punxerunt colaphizando, flagellando, conspuendo, et  illudendo, et mortem intentando.
<td style=text-align:justify>They  stung Christ by beating, scourging, spitting upon and ridiculing him, and  by aiming at his death.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  hoc est quod dicit, <I>Multi insurgunt,</I> scilicet factis. Absalon enim  voluit occidere David, ut patet in consilio Chusi, <I>2. Reg. 17.  </I>Similiter et Iudas tradidit Christum ad mortem.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  this is what he says, <I>Many rise up,</I> namely, (<I>factis </I>- in  their deeds ?). Absalon wanted to kill David, as is clear in Chusai's  advice, at, <I>2 Kings 17.</I> Likewise did Judas hand Christ over to  death.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  tribulant verbis detrahendo, sive falsa proponendo: unde <I>Multi  dicunt</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Again, they afflict by disparaging words, or by proposing lies. Hence  <I>Many say</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Contra illud quod dicitur <I>Ps. 36. Salus autem iustorum a Domino.</I>  Si enim hoc considerarent impii, non de facili insurgerent contra iustos;  sed quia hoc non credunt, vel quia contemnunt Dei potentiam vel hominis  iustitiam, ideo dicunt ore, et opere, <I>Non est salus illi</I> etc.,  idest in eo quem colit, et sibi Deum facit.
<td style=text-align:justify>Against that is what is said at <I>Psalm 36: But the salvation of the  just is from the Lord.</I> For if the impious considered this, they would  not easily rise up against the just; but because they do not believe, or  because they despise the power of God or the justice of man, for this  reason they say, in word and deed, <I>There is no salvation for him</I>  etc., that is, in him whom he worships, and takes as God to  himself.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Hoc  dicunt etiam persecutores de Christo: si enim resurrecturum sperarent, nec  Iudas traderet, nec illi occiderent. Et est sensus.
<td style=text-align:justify>Even  the persecutors of Christ say this: for if they were expecting him to rise  again shortly, Judas would not have betrayed him, nor would they have  killed him. And this is the sense:
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Non  salvabit eum, nec est filius Dei: unde dicebant <I>Matth. 17. Si filius  Dei es, descende de cruce:</I> et infra, <I>Si rex Israel est, descendat  nunc de cruce, et credimus ei?</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>He  will not save him, nor is he the son of God. Thus they said at <I>Matthew  17: If you are the son of God, come down from the cross;</I> and in the  same place, <I>If he is the king of Israel, let him come down from the  cross and we will believe him</I>?
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>b.</B> Haec est pars secunda. Ubi ostendit sibi a Deo paratum  auxilium. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit sibi specialiter adesse  divinum auxilium. Secundo generaliter omnibus, ibi, <I>Domini est  salus.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>This  is the second part wherein he shows the help prepared for him by God. And  concerning this he does two things. First, he shows that the divine help  is present to him especially, and secondly to everyone in general, at,  <I>Salvation is of the Lord.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  circa primum tria proponit. Primo auxilium divinum. Secundo auxilii  experimentum, ibi, <I>Voce mea.</I> Tertio securitatis conceptum, ibi,  <I>Non timebo.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>And  concerning the first, he sets forth three things. First, the divine help,  second, the experience of this help, at, <I>with my voice,</I> and third,  the <I>conceptum</I> (conception, thought ?) of safety, at, <I>I will not  fear.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dicit ergo, <I>Tu autem Domine;</I> quasi dicat, Isti insurgunt ad  bellandum, sed tu suscipis ad protegendum.
<td style=text-align:justify>Therefore, he says, <I>But you, O Lord;</I> as if he were saying, Those  people rise up to wage war, but you undertake to defend.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  hoc est melius per literam Hieronymi quae dicit, <I>Clypeus meus circa  me,</I> quasi defendens me sicut clypeus.
<td style=text-align:justify>This  is better rendered by Jerome's version which states, <I>My shield around  me,</I> as it were, defending me like a shield.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  non solum servans in vita contra delere volentes, sed etiam in gloria  contra infamantes; unde ait <I>Gloria mea: 2. Cor. 10. Qui gloriatur, in  Domino glorietur: Hier. 9. In hoc glorietur qui gloriatur scire, et nosse  me.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Furthermore, not only preserving against those wanting to destroy in  life, but also against those defaming in glory; thus he says <I>My Glory -  2 Cor. 10: He who would glory, let him glory in the Lord; Jeremiah 9: Let  him that glories, glory in this, that he understands and know  me.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  non solum contra infamantes mihi assistis, sed etiam praevalere me facis  contra opprimentes; unde subiungit <I>Exaltans caput meum: Ps. 26. Et nunc  exaltavi caput meum super inimicos meos.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Not  only do you defend me against those defaming, but you also make me to  prevail against those oppressing me; thus he adds, <I>The one who lifts up  my head - Psalm 26: And now I have lifted up my head above my  enemies.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Haec  possunt referri ad Christum, qui conceptus fuit secundum humanam naturam  in incarnatione, quoniam <I>Verbum caro factum est, Io. 1. Isa. 42. Ecce  servus meus suscipiam eum, electus meus complacuit sibi in illo anima mea:  Ps. 40. Beatus quem elegisti et assumpsisti.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>These things can be referred to Christ, who was conceived in accordance  with human nature at the Incarnation; for <I>The Word was made flesh (John  1) - Isaiah 42: Behold my servant, I will uphold him: my elect, my soul  delights in him; Psalm 64: Blessed is he who you have choosen and taken to  yourself.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  gloriosus fuit in resurrectione: <I>Io. 16. Clarifica me tu  pater.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Furthermore, he was glorified in his resurrection <I>(John 16: Glorify  me, Father),</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  exaltatus in ascensione: <I>Phi. 2. Propter quod et Deus</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>and  exalted in his ascension <I>(Philipians 2: On account of which God has  also exalted him)</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>c.</B> Deinde cum dicit, <I>Voce,</I> ostendit experimentum auxilii.  Et ponit tria, scilicet orationem, <I>Voce mea.</I> Secundo exauditionem,  <I>Et exaudivit me.</I> Tertio ostendit in quo est exauditus, ubi ait,  <I>Ego dormivi</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Next, when he says, <I>With my voice,</I> he shows the experience of  this help. He describes three things, namely his prayer, at, <I>With my  voice,</I> second, the hearkening, at, <I>And he heard me,</I> and third,  where (?) he was heard, where he says, <I>I have slept.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Circa primum duo tangit quae debent esse in oratione: nam debet esse  attenta. Et ideo dicit, <I>Voce mea,</I> scilicet cordis quae sonat Deo,  qua Moyses tacens ore, clamabat corde ad Dominum: <I>Ex. 14. Dixit  Dominus, Quid clamas ad me</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Concerning the first, he treats of two things which must appear in  prayer. First, it must be attended to. And thus he says, <I>With my  voice,</I> namely of the heart which speaks to God, and with which Moses  used to cry out to the Lord, while keeping his mouth silent - <I>Exodus  14: The Lord said, Why do you cry out to me</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Hac  etiam voce clamans Susanna est exaudita: <I>Dan. 13. Quae flens suspexit  in caelum, erat enim cor eius habens fiduciam in Domino</I> etc. <I>1.  Reg. 1. Porro Anna loquebatur in corde suo</I> etc. <I>1. Cor. 15. Orabo  spiritu, orabo et mente.</I> Et ideo dicit <I>Mea.</I> Vox enim quando non  procedit ex corde, non est mea.
<td style=text-align:justify>Susanna was also heard crying out with this voice - <I>Daniel 13: And  she weeping, looked up to heaven, for her heart had confidence in the  Lord</I> etc.; <I>1 Kings 1: Now Anna spoke in her heart</I> etc.; <I>1  Cor. 14: I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the  understanding.</I> And thus he says <I>My.</I> For when the voice does not  go out from the heart, it is not mine.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  debet esse recta: tunc enim est recta, quando tendit ubi debet: et ideo  dicit, <I>Ad Dominum,</I> ubi est auxilium: <I>2. Paral. 20. Cum ignoramus  quid agere debeamus, hoc solum habemus residium, ut oculos nostros  dirigamus ad te: Ps. 102. Auxilium meum a Domino.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Furthermore, it must be right: for it is then right when it tends to  where it must: and thus he says, <I>To the Lord,</I> where help is - <I>2  Paralipomenon 20: But as we know not what we ought to do, this alone  remains to us, that we turn our eyes to you; Psalm 120: My help is from  the Lord.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  debet esse devota. Unde addidit <I>Clamavi:</I> clamosa namque dicitur  oratio, propter magnitudinem affectus: <I>Ps. 10. Clamor meus ad te  veniat</I> etc. <I>Heb. 5. Cum clamore valido et lacrymis</I>  etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Furthermore, it must be devout. Thus he adds, <I>I have cried:</I> for a  prayer is called loud (or clamoring) according to the magnitude of one's  longing - <I>Psalm 101: Let my cry come to you</I> etc.; <I>Hebrews 5:  With a strong cry and tears </I>etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Deinde ponitur exauditio cum dicit, <I>Et exaudivit de monte,</I> idest  de sublimitate divinae maiestatis, quae inaccessibilis est: <I>Ps. 23.  Quis ascendet in montem Domini,</I> idest ad omnipotentiam suam, vel de  altitudine iustitiae suae, quia incomprehensibilis est: <I>Ps. 17. Iudicia  tua abyssus multa:</I> vel <I>in monte sancto,</I> idest de me qui eram  mons sanctus, de quo <I>Isa. 2. Et erit in novissimis diebus praeparatus  mons domus Domini</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>The  hearkening is described next when he says, <I>And he heard me from his  mountain,</I> that is, from the loftiness of his divine majesty, which is  unapproachable - <I>Psalm 23: Who shall ascend to the mountain of the  Lord,</I> that is, to his omnipotence; or from the height of his justice,  which is incomprehensible or boundless - <I>Psalm 35: Your judgments are a  great deep;</I> or <I>on your holy mountain,</I> that is, (<I>de me qui  eram mons sanctus),</I> concerning which there is <I>Isaiah 2: And in the  last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared</I>  etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sequitur, <I>Ego dormivi.</I> Ubi ostendit in quo sit exauditus. Quia  <I>surrexi.</I> Est autem differentia inter mortuum et dormientem, quia  mortuus non resurgit: <I>Iob 14. Putasne mortuus homo rursum vivet;  </I>dormiens vero resurgit: <I>Ps. 40. Nunquid qui dormit non adiiciet ut  resurgat?</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>I  have slept</I> follows, wherein he describes where (?) he was heard. For  <I>I have risen.</I> There is a difference between the dead and those  sleeping, for the dead do not get up - <I>Job 14: Do you think that a man  that is dead shall live again? - </I>while those sleeping do get up -  <I>Psalm 40: Shall he that sleeps rise again no more?</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sic  ergo quando tribulatio est tanta ut homo non redeat ad statum priorem,  dicitur mors. Sed quando tribulatus, vel tentatus cadit in peccatum et  resurgit, dicitur dormire. Sic David quasi dormivit, quia liberatus est a  filio et peccato.
<td style=text-align:justify>So  therefore when tribulation is so great that a person does not return to  his prior condition, this is called death. But when the one suffering  tribulation or trial falls into sin but rises (again from it), this is  called sleep. In this way David slept, as it were, because he was freed  from his son and from sin.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dicitur autem dormire, quasi parum, soporari vero, quasi multum: unde  alia litera dicit, <I>Somnum cepi,</I> idest profunde dormivi.
<td style=text-align:justify>However one is said to sleep, as if a little, but to sleep deeply, as if  greatly: another version says, <I>I have taken sleep,</I> that is, I have  slept deeply.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sic  Chrstus dicitur dormivisse, quia sponte se passioni obtulit: et quia  soporatus est, mors subsecuta est. Unde a dormitione transivit ad  somnum.
<td style=text-align:justify>Christ is said to have slept thus since he bore the passion on his own  accord: and since he slept deeply, death ensued. Hence, he travelled from  sleep to a deep sleep.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Iste  sopor signatur in sopore Adam: <I>Gen. 2. Immisit Dominus soporem in  Adam</I> etc. quia de latere Christi in cruce mortui formata est  ecclesia.
<td style=text-align:justify>This  deep sleep is signified in the deep sleep of Adam - <I>Genesis 2: The Lord  cast a deep sleep upon Adam</I> etc., because from the side of Christ in  his death on the cross was built the Church.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Ait  ergo, <I>Et exurrexi,</I> propria scilicet virtute: <I>Io. 10. Potestatem  habeo ponendi animam meam, et potestatem habeo iterum sumendi eam. </I>Et  hoc est, quia <I>Dominus suscepit me.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Therefore he says, <I>And I have risen up,</I> namely by my own power -  <I>John 10: I have the power to lay my soul down, and I have the power to  take it up again.</I> And this happens because <I>The Lord has protected  me.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Alia  litera, <I>Sustentavit.</I> Habuit enim virtutem divinitatis, quod  surgeret: <I>Ps. 25. Cum ceciderit iustus, non collidetur, quia Dominus  supponit manum suam.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Another version has, <I>He has sustained (me).</I> For he had the power  of divinity because he rose - <I>Psalm 36: When he falls, he shall not be  bruised, for the Lord puts his hand under him.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>d. </B>Deinde cum dicit, <I>Non timebo,</I> ponitur fiducia  securitatis, quasi dicat ex quo sum exauditus, <I>Non timebo</I> etc.  <I>infra. Ps. 26. Si consistant adversum me castra</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>Next, when he says, <I>I will not fear,</I> he describes the confidence  of safety, as if he were saying, Since I was heard, <I>I will not fear</I>  etc. - <I>Psalm 26: If armies in camp should stand together against me, my  heart shall not fear.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>In  quo signatur, quod Christi ecclesia non potest omnino deprimi. Christo  etiam post resurrectionem multitudo populi, quae crucifixum circumstetit,  nihil nocere potuit: nam <I>Christus resurgens ex mortuis iam non moritur,  Rom. 6.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>It  is here signified that the Church of Christ cannot be wholly overwhelmed.  For the multitude of people, who stood round the crucifix, were in no way  able to harm Christ after the resurrection: for <I>Christ rising from the  dead, dies now no more (Romans 6).</I>

<td style=text-align:justify>Et  unde habeat istam fiduciam, ostendit cum dicit, <I>Exurge,</I> scilicet  manifesta virtutem tuam faciendo me resurgere a morte: et hoc est,  <I>Salvum me fac</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  thus he has this confidence, which he shows when he says, <I>Arise,</I>  namely, manifest your power by making me rise up from the dead: and this  is at <I>Make me safe</I> etc.

<td style=text-align:justify><I>Quoniam pater </I>etc. Supra duo dixerat. Quod tribulant eum: <I>Ps.  3. Domine quid multiplicati sunt, qui tribulant me,</I> et contra hos  dicit, <I>Quoniam tu percussisti,</I> item infamabant, <I>Non est salus  illi</I> etc. et contra hos, <I>Dentes peccatorum,</I> idest maledica  verba in irritum deduxisti: <I>Iob 19. Conterebam molas iniqui</I> etc.  Litera Hieronymi habet, <I>Percussit molas.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>For the father</I> etc. Previously, he had said two things. First,  that they distress him - <I>Psalm 3: Why, O Lord, have those who afflict  me increased in number?</I> - and against these he says, <I>For you have  struck.</I> Second, they were defaming, <I>There is no salvation for  them</I> etc., and against these he says, <I>The teeth of sinners,</I>  that is, you have rendered their lying words ineffectual - <I>Job 29: I  broke the jaws of the wicked</I> etc. Jerome's version has, <I>I struck  the jaws.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Et dentes;</I> quasi dicat, Ita fortiter percussisti quod dentes  contriti sunt. Maxilla fuit Absalon, dentes vero adhaerentes sibi. Unde  destructo Absalone, alii sunt contriti.
<td style=text-align:justify><I>And the teeth;</I> as if he were saying, Thus you have strongly  struck because their teeth have been crushed. The jaw was Absalon, but the  teeth were those clinging to him. Thus, when Absalon was destroyed, the  others were crushed.

<td style=text-align:justify><B>e.</B> Ultimo cum dicit <I>Domini</I> ostendit auxilium divinum esse  toti populo. Et primo quantum ad conservationem a malo; et ideo dicit,  <I>Domini est salus. </I>Et ideo oratio dirigi debet ad  Deum<I>.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Finally, when he says <I>Of the Lord,</I> he shows divine help to be  present to all the people. And first, with respect to preservation from  evil; thus he says, <I>Salvation is of the Lord.</I> And for this reason  prayer ought to be directed to God.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Secundo quantum ad multiplicationem bonorum; et ideo dicit: <I>Super  populum tuum benedictio tua, </I>idest super populum, quidem te, et in te  sperat, et non in alio.
<td style=text-align:justify>Second, with respect to the multiplication of goods; and thus he says,  <I>Your blessing is upon your people,</I> that is, upon the people who  hope in you and not in another.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Benedictio tua.</I> Benedictio Domini semper importat  multiplicationem bonorum: <I>Prov. 10. Benedictio Domini divites  facit.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Your blessing.</I> The blessing of the Lord always includes the  multiplication of goods - <I>Proverbs 10: The blessing of the Lord makes  men rich.</I>

<td style=text-align:justify>However, this very psalm can be read in another way according to a  gloss, namely so that by it, all of Christ, that is the Church, speaks and  is appointed as his head during the storms of persecution.

<td style=text-align:justify>Or  this psalm can be read morally in the person of all the faithful, who are  attacked by sinful habits and desires.

<td style=text-align:justify>Et  secundum hoc per David accipitur quilibet fidelis, per Absalon vitia  carnalis concupiscentiae, sicut patet in glossa.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  according to this, by David is understood the faithful, and by Absalon,  the vices of carnal desire, as is clear in the gloss.</TABLE>
