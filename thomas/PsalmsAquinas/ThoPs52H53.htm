<td style=text-align:justify><b>In  finem pro Melech intellegentiae David a. Dixit insipiens in corde suo non  est Deus.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>Unto  the end, for Maeleth, understandings to David. The fool said in his heart:  There is no God.

<td style=text-align:justify><b>b.  Corrupti sunt et abominabiles facti sunt in iniquitatibus. Non est qui  faciat bonum.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>They  are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that  doth good.

<td style=text-align:justify><b>c.  Deus de caelo prospexit in filios hominum ut videat si est intellegens aut  requirens Deum.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>God  looked down from heaven on the children of men: to see if there were any  that did understand, or did seek God.

<td style=text-align:justify><b>e.  Omnes declinaverunt simul inutiles facti sunt; non est qui faciat bonum  non est usque ad unum.

<td style=text-align:justify><B>a.</B> <I>Dixit insipiens</I>. Supra psalmista arguit nequitiam  peccatorum ex parte affectionis ad peccatum; hic arguit eorum nequitiam ex  contemptu Dei. 
<td style=text-align:justify><I>The fool said</I>. In the previous Psalm, the Psalmist exposed the  wickedness of sinners coming from the affection toward the sin; here he  sheds light on their wickedness coming from the contempt for  God.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Titulus: <I>In finem intellectus David pro Amalech</I>. Huius historia  habetur <I>1. Reg. 17. </I>quando David fugiens venit ad Achis regem  Philisthinorum qui dedit ei civitatem siceleg, et contigit quod  Amalecitae, eo absente, incenderent civitatem, tandem David insecutus est  eos et recuperavit praedam. 
<td style=text-align:justify>The  title, <I>Unto the end, for Maeleth, understandings to David</I>. This  story is found in <I>1 Kings 17</I> when David came in flight to Achis the  king of the Philistines, who gave him the charge over the city, when it so  happened that, he being away, the Amalecites burned the city, David at  last pursued them and recovered their booty.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Mystice per David significatur Christus; et sicut in glossa dicitur,  Amalecitae populus lambens sanguinem, et significant Antichristum et suos  qui lambunt affectu carnalia. <I>Matt. 16: Caro et sanguis,</I> etc. Ergo  sicut interpretetur malitia eorum, et ex hoc ducuntur in Christum.  
<td style=text-align:justify>In a  mystical sense, by David, Christ is signified, and just as it is said in  the gloss, the people of the Amalecites lick blood, and they signify the  Antichrist and his people who bathe in carnal desire - <I>Matthew 16:</I>  <I>Because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee</I>. Therefore  their evil is explained, and for this reason, they are led out of it to  Christ.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Augustinus dicit <I>pro Maeleth</I>, quod interpretatur dolens et  parturiens; et significat ecclesiam, de qua<I> Ioan. 16: Mulier cum parit  tristitiam habet</I>, etc.; et sic est (Psalmus) pro tribulationibus quas  patitur ecclesia pro malis mundi. 
<td style=text-align:justify>Augustine says <I>for Maileth</I>, which is interpreted as suffering  pain and in childbirth; and he signifies the Church, about which, <I>John  16: A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow </I>etc. And so this Psalm  is for the tribulations that the Church suffers for the evils of the  world. 
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  hoc ergo est per Core, qui fuit unus de cantoribus principibus; et sic  iste psalmus cantatus est eius ministerio. Item sciendum est quod iste  Psalmus positus est supra <I>13</I> non tamen est idem circulus, nec omnes  versus, et ibi introducitur propter primum adventum Christi; hic propter  adventum Christi ad iudicium. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  this is therefore by Core, who was one of the chief singers; and this  Psalm, sung, is his ministry. Likewise, it should be known that this Psalm  is written above, at <I>13</I>; it is not, however, the same circle, nor  all the same verses. And there it is introduced on account of the first  coming of Christ; here it is introduced on account of the coming of Christ  to Judgement.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  circa hoc duo facit. Primo ponit peccatorum malitiam. Secundo introducitur  divinum iudicium, ibi, <I>Dominus de coelo</I>. Circa primum duo facit.  Primo ponit radicem mali, scilicet contemptum. Secundo ostendit quid ex  tali radice sequitur, ibi, <I>Corrupti sunt</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  with respect to the first, he does two things. First he sets down the evil  of sinners. Second, he introduces the divine Judgements, whence, <I>God  looked down from heaven</I>. He does two things with respect to the first.  First he sets down the root of the evil, namely contempt. Second, he shows  what follows from such a root, whence, <I>They are  corrupted</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sciendum est quod sapientia, si proprie sumatur, differat a scientia,  quia sapientia est circa divinorum cognitionem, scientia circa humanorum  cognitionem. Vir insipiens contemnit cognitionem divinorum. <I>Job. 22:  Recede a nobis, et scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus. Rom. 1: obscuratum est  insipiens</I>, etc.. Dixit ergo <I>insipiens</I>; idest contempsit Deum et  scientiam Dei; et hoc fecit in corde suo, dixit:<I> non est Deus</I>.  
<td style=text-align:justify>It  should be known that wisdom, grasped properly, differs from knowledge, for  wisdom has to do with divine cognition, and knowledge with human  cognition. The foolish man contemns divine cognition - <I>Job 22: Who said  to God: Depart from us: [we do not want to know your ways];</I> <I>Rom. 1:  Their foolish heart was darkened</I>, etc. Therefore, <I>The fool  said</I>, that is he contemns God and the knowledge of God; and he does  this in his heart, he said, <I>There is no God</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Contra; Anselmus dicit, <I>quod nullus potest cogitare Deum non  esse</I>. Dicendum quod dupliciter potest aliquid esse nobis ignotum. Uno  modo propter se; alio modo propter nos. Primo modo sunt nobis ignota illa  quae habent primum de esse, ut contingentia, materia prima, motus et  tempus. Secundo modo sunt nobis ignota illa quae excellunt cognitionem  nostram.
<td style=text-align:justify>Against this, Anselm says, <I>Nobody is capable of thinking God not to  be</I>. We should say that there are two ways in which something can be  unknown to us. In one way, on its own account, in the other way, with  respect to us. In the first way, things are unknown to us that are  foremost with respect to being, like contingency, prime matter, motion,  and time. In the second way, those things are unknown to us that excel our  cognition.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dico  ergo quod si consideremus Deum secundum Se Ipsum, sic non potest cogitari  non esse, et nulla propositio est magis nota illa cuius praedicatum  includitur in subiecto. Esse Dei est eius essentia, et ideo haec  propositio: Deus est, est maxime per se nota, tamen quoad nos essentia Dei  non est nobis nota, sed innoscitur nobis per suos effectus;
<td style=text-align:justify>I  say therefore that if we consider God in Himself, he cannot be thought not  to be, and no proposition is better known than that one whose predicate is  included in the subject. God's being is his essence and thus this  proposition: "God is" is known to the highest degree with respect to  itself, while however the essence of God is not known to us, but it  becomes known to us by its effects.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  inde est quod qui negat aliquos effectus Dei, puta providentiam hominum  bonorum et malorum et omnium universaliter, et miracula Dei, et quod  omnipotens non sit, negat Deum, et dicit in corde, quia a Deo est in corde  omnium quod Deus sit, quod nullus quidem hoc velit, reputatur insipiens,  quod dicat Deum non esse. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  so it is that he who denies any effects of God whatsoever, including the  Providence of good and evil men and all things universally, and miracles  from God, and denies that he would not be omniscient, denies God. And, he  says in his heart, since everything that God is, is in the heart from God  [by God's agency], and since he chooses none of this, it is reported of  the fool, that he says that there is no God.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Vel  insipiens, idest Iudaeus. <I>Psalm. 93: Intelligite[qui] insipientes</I>;  quod dixit quod Christus non est Deus. <I>Ioan. 10: Tu homo cum sis, facis  te ipsum Deum</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>Or  the fool is the Jews - <I>Psalm. 93:</I> <I>Understand, ye senseless among  the people</I>,<I> </I>who said that Christ is not God; <I>John. 10: That  thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>b.</B> <I>Corrupti sunt</I>. Hic est effectus malitiae eorum. Sicut  timor, cognitio, et amor Dei est principium omnis boni operis, ita sublata  cognitione et amore Dei omnis bona vita tollitur. Et primo ostendit quod  sequitur quantum ad operationem mali: secundo quantum ad amissionem boni.  
<td style=text-align:justify><I>They are corrupted</I>. Here is the effect of their wickedness. Just  as the fear, cognition, and love of God is the principle of every good  work, so when the cognition and love of God are taken away, every good  life is taken away. And first he points out what follows with respect to  the work of evil; second with respect to the loss of the good.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sunt  duo mala quae consequuntur. Primum est quia corrupti sunt. Corpus  corrumpitur per exalationem caloris naturalis et per subtractionem  actualis caloris exterioris. Calor naturalis animae humanae est ipse Deus;  et ideo quamdiu est in anima cognitio de Deo anima continet suam formam  quam Deus impressit, scilicet innocentiam et imaginem divinam, sed quando  iste calor exalatur, subtrahitur actualis calor, scilicet concupiscentiae  calor et timoris, corrumpitur anima, et consequenter sequitur quod multi  timorem et amorem et Dei cognitionem a se abiiciant et corrumpantur in  immunditiis; et ideo abominabiles facti sunt in iniquitatibus. <I>Osee 9:  Facti sunt abominabiles sicut ea quae dilexerunt.</I> 
<td style=text-align:justify>There are two evils that are consequences of this. The first is that  they are corrupted. The body is corrupted by the exhalation of natural  heat and by the subtraction of actual exterior heat. The natural heat of  the human soul is God Himself; and so therefore so long as there is a  cognition of God in the soul, it contains its form that God has impressed,  namely innocence and the divine image, but when this heat has been taken  out, the actual heat, namely the heat of lust and fear, drags it down, the  soul is corrupted, and consequently it follows that many throw away the  fear and love and cognition of God, and they are corrupted in unclean  pursuits - <I>Osee 9: [They] became abominable, as those things were,  which they loved</I>. 
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  dicit iniquitatem, idest propter iniquitates, et amittunt etiam bonum.  Unus non est qui facit bonum. <I>Ier. 4: Sapientes sunt ut faciant mala,  bona autem facere nescierunt</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  he says <I>Iniquities</I>, that is on account of iniquities, and they even  put aside the good. There is not one who does the good - <I>Jeremias  4:</I> <I>They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no  knowledge</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>c.</B> <I>De coelo prospexit</I>. Hic ponitur Dei iudicium contra  malos. Et primo inducitur consideratio iudicis. Secundo ostenditur quid  iudex inveniat, quia <I>Omnes declinaverunt</I>. Tertio additur sententia,  <I>Nonne sciunt</I>? Causa quia negant Deum est, quia credunt quod propter  suam altitudinem Deus non aspiciat novissima. <I>Iob 22: An non cogitas  quod Deus excelsior sit caelo?</I> etc. 
<td style=text-align:justify><I>God looked down from heaven</I>. Here he sets down God's judgement  against evil people. And first he brings up the consideration of the  judge. Second, he indicates the reason why the judge comes, because <I>All  have gone aside</I>. Third, the thought, <I>Shall not all the workers of  iniquity know</I>, is added. The reason why they deny that God exists, is  that they believe because of their own high position, God will not  perceive the most recent things [they have done] - <I>Job 22:</I> <I>Dost  not thou think that God is higher than heaven </I>etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dicis quid? Per caliginem iudicat, circa cardines caeli perambulat, nec  nostra considerat. Sed hoc ad perfectionem suae sapientiae spectat quod  omnia prospiciat. <I>Ps. 112: Quis sicut Deus noster, qui in altis habitat  et humilia respicit in coelo et in terra?</I> 
<td style=text-align:justify>What  are you saying? That He would judge as through a dark mist, he would  meander around the poles of the sky, he would not consider our deeds? But  He looks to that, to the perfection of his wisdom, he clearly sees  everything - <I>Psalm 112: Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on  high and looketh down on the low things in heaven and in  earth</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  ideo dicit quod Dominus etiam <I>de coelo prospexit</I>, idest considerat  filios hominum de sua altitudine. <I>Eccli. 16: Quae est enim anima mea in  tam immensa creatura? Prov. 16: Omnes viae hominum patent oculis suis. Ps.  13: Dominus de coelo </I>in terram<I> prospexit.</I> 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  so therefore he says that the Lord <I>looked down from Heaven</I>, that  is, he considers the sons of men from His height - <I>Ecclesiasticus  16:</I> <I>For what is my soul in such an immense creation?;</I>  <I>Proverbs 16: All the ways of a man are open to his eyes</I>;<I> Psalm  13: The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of  men.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Vel  de coelo, idest de Christo. Vel de anima iusti. Inquirit in filiis hominum  <I>Ut videat si est intelligens, aut requirens Deum</I>. Differentia est  inter Deum et hominem quia iudices homines inquirunt quae exterius  aguntur, Deus autem intuetur cor. <I>Psalm. 7: Scrutans corda et renes  Deus</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>Or,  <I>From Heaven</I>, that is, from Christ. Or from the soul of a just man.  He examinded the sons of men, <I>To see if there were any that did  understand, or did seek God.</I> The difference between God and man here  is that when men are judges they inquire into the things that concern the  external, but God, however, considers the heart - <I>Psalm 7: The searcher  of hearts and reins [kidneys] is God</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>d.</B> <I>In corde</I>. Sunt duo quae oportet circa Deum fieri,  scilicet ut intellectus intus figatur in Dei cognitionem et affectus  tendat in Deum sicut in finem. Unde dicit ideo prospicit ut videat si est  intellectus. 
<td style=text-align:justify><I>In his heart</I>. There are two things that ought to take place with  respect to God, namely that the intellect be inwardly fixed on the  cognition of God, and that the movement of desire tend towards God as if  towards its end. For this reason, he says that He looked down to see if  there was any understanding [of Him].
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Ut  si de iusto intelligatur, in suavitate redarguens; si autem intelligatur  de malo, sicut de eo dicitur noluit intelligere ut bene ageret, sic est  requirens, scilicet facturus ut perveniat ad Ipsum. <I>Ps. 68: Quaerite  Dominus [Deum], et vivet</I>, etc. Sed Dominus prospiciens, ut hoc videat  invenit malitiam abundantem.
<td style=text-align:justify>So  that if a just man attempts to understand God, God contradicts him in an  agreeable way. But, if an evil man attempts to understand God, even though  it is said of him that he chooses not to understand so that he might act  well, still, he is seeking what he must do so that he comes to God Himself  - <I>Psalm 68: Seek ye God, and your soul shall live</I>. But God looks  down, so that he sees that he arrives at abundant wickedness.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>e.</B> <I>Omnes declinaverunt</I>. Et tangit primo recessum a radice.  Secundo dicit quod inde sequitur. Et circa hoc exponit. Dicit ergo, hic  inquirit, sed invenit quod <I>Omnes declinaverunt</I>, <I>simul inutiles  facti sunt</I>; et iterum, <I>Non est qui faciat bonum</I>. Ab  intelligentia et inquisitione Dei omnes recesserunt. <I>Isaiae 53:  Unusquisque declinavit in viam suam</I>. Ex hoc sequitur quod sunt  inutiles et sibi et aliis. 
<td style=text-align:justify><I>All have gone aside</I>. And first, he touches upon the moving away  from the root. Second, he says what it is that follows from this. And  regarding this, he explains. He says therefore, that He inquired, but He  discovered that <I>All have gone aside, they have become unprofitable  together</I>; and furthermore, <I>There is none that doth good</I>.  Everyone has fallen away from the understanding and seeking out of God -  <I>Isaias 53: Every one hath turned aside into his own way</I>.<I> </I>And  so it follows that they are unprofitable both for themselves and for  others. 
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Nam  qui non habent amorem Dei non habent veram fidem; quaecumque opera de  genere bonorum faciat inutilia sunt sibi ad praemium vitae aeternae.  Propterea dicit, <I>Simul inutiles facti sunt</I>, idest inutilia opera  fecere. <I>Cor. 13: Si distribuero in cibos pauperum</I>, etc.. <I>Isaiae.  14: Proiectus de sepulcro tuo,</I> etc.. 
<td style=text-align:justify>Now,  those who do not have love of God do not have true faith; whatever works  of the genus of good works he performs, they are still unprofitable to him  to the reward of eternal life. So, he says, <I>they have become  unprofitable together, </I>that is, they have performed unprofitable works  - <I>1 Corinthians 13: And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the  poor</I>, etc. <I>Isaiah</I> <I>1: But thou art cast out of thy  grave.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  exponit quomodo sunt inutiles, quia <I>Non est qui faciat bonum</I>, quia  ea quae non fiunt in virtute fidei et non sunt informata amore Dei, non  sunt bona simpliciter. <I>Rom. 14.: Quod non est ex fide, mortuum est</I>.  Et quod declinaverunt ostendit cum dicit, <I>Non est usque ad unum</I>,  idest nec unus invenitur bonus. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  he elaborates the manner in which they are unprofitable, because <I>There  is none that doth good</I>, because those things that do not take place in  the virtue of faith and are not informed by the love of God, are not good  in themselves - <I>Romans 14: For all that is not of faith is sin.</I> And  he indicates that they have fallen away when he says, <I>No, not one</I>,  that is, not one is found to be good.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sed  numquid non est aliquis bonus in universo? Dicendum, quod uno modo si  referatur ad collegium malorum, sic nullus est bonus. Alio modo  universaliter. Sic <I>Non est usque ad unum</I>, idest usque ad Christum  non est qui propria virtute sit bonus. <I>Phil. 2: Deus qui operatur in  nobis</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>But  is there not at all someone good in the whole world? It is to be said  that, in one way, if this is referred to the band of evil people, there is  no good man. In another way, universally. So, <I>No, not one</I>, that is,  except for Christ, there is nobody who is by his own virtue good -  <I>Phillipians 2: For it is God who worketh in you</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>f.</B> <I>Nonne scient</I>, etc.. Supra induxit psalmista iudicem  prospicientem iniquitatem et inutilitatem. Hic agit de sententia iudicii.  Et primo quantum ad condemnationem malorum. Secundo quantum ad salvationem  bonorum, ibi, <I>Quis dabit</I>, etc.. 
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Shall not all the workers of iniquity know?</I> Above, the Psalmist  brought up the topic of the judge looking down and seeing wickedness and  unprofitableness. Here it is a matter of the sentence of judgement. And  first as it relates to the condemnation of the evil. Second, as it relates  to the salvation of the good, at, <I>Who will give</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Primo duo facit. Primo proponit quaestionem. Secundo propositam  manifestat, ibi, <I>Quoniam Deus dissipabit.</I> Circa primum duo facit.  Primo investigat ipsum defectum poenitentiae. Secundo meritum poenae  assignat, ibi, <I>Qui operatur</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>First, he does two things. First, he sets forth the questioning. Second,  he reveals what is promised, at, <I>For God hath scattered</I>. He does  two things with respect to the first. First he investigates that very lack  of repentance. Second, he signifies the reason why punishment is merited,  at, <I>The workers of iniquity</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Circa primum considerandum est quod frequenter contigit quod in statu  prosperitatis homines non recognoscant Deum, sed per poenas a Deo  inflictas recordantur quod sit Deus, quasi dicat: Et hoc necessarium est  propter culpam. <I>Psalm. 9: Cognoscetur [cognoscitur] Dominus iudicia  faciens</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>Regarding the first, it ought to be known that it frequently so happens  that men in the condition of prosperity do not recognize God, but by  punishments inflicted from God, they are reminded that there is a God, as  if to say, "it is necessary because of fault" - <I>Psalm 9: The Lord shall  be known when he executeth judgments.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  huius exemplum habemus in Pharaone. <I>Exod. 5: Nescio Dominum</I>. Et  post poenas inflictas dixerunt (Aegyptii): Fugiamus Israelem, Dominus enim  pugnat pro eis contra nos. Dictum est autem supra quod <I>Dixit insipiens  non est Deus</I>, et ob hoc dicit: <I>Nonne scient omnes qui operantur  iniquitatem,</I> saltem per poenas quod sit Deus? 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  we have an example of this in Pharoah - <I>Exodus 5: I know not the Lord.  </I>And, because of the punishments inflicted, they (the Egyptians) said,  "Let us flee Israel. For God fights for them against us." It was said  above that <I>The fool said...there is no God</I>, and for this reason he  says, <I>Shall not all the workers of iniquity know</I>, at the very least  by punishments, that there is a God?
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Quasi dicat: Imo scient quod nullus potest poenas infligere nisi Deus.  Et hoc necessarium est valde propter culpam quam commiserunt. Et  commiserunt duplicem culpam, scilicet in opere et in affectu. 
<td style=text-align:justify>As  if to say, "Nay, they shall know, that nobody can inflict punishment save  God". And this is quite necessary, on account of the fault that they have  committed. And they have committed a twofold fault, namely in the deed and  in the desire.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Culpa est operatio iniquitatis; et ideo dicit, <I>Qui operantur  iniquitatem.</I> Iniquitas proprie est peccatum in proximum, quia  opponitur aequitati. Hanc culpam exaggerat cum dicit: <I>Qui devorant  plebem meam ut cibum panis</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>Fault is the work of iniquity; and so he says, <I>The workers of  iniquity</I>. Iniquity, properly, is sin against a neighbor, for it is  opposed to equity. And he exaggerates this fault when he says, <I>Who eat  up my people as they eat bread</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Cibus panis est assiduus et delectabilis, quasi dicat: Isti in suis  malitiis delectabiliter perseverant et in iniuriis inferendis delectantur.  <I>Michaee 3: Comederunt carnes populi mei et cadavera eorum, et  abstulerunt bona eorum. Ierem. 50: Primus rex</I> <I>Assur</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>Bread is soft and delightful, so it is as if to say, "These people  persevere with delight in their evils, and they are delighted in the  injuries that they will inflict" - <I>Micheas 3: Who have eaten the flesh  of my people, and have flayed their skin from off them: and have broken,  and chopped their bones as for the kettle, and as flesh in the midst of  the pot; Jeremias 50:</I> <I>First the king of Assyria devoured  him.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Quantum ad effectum dicit, <I>Deum non invocaverunt</I>. Dupliciter sunt  inordinati peccatores in affectu. Primo per contemptum Dei. Secundo per  inordinatum amorem ad temporalia. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And,  as an effect, he says, <I>They have not called on God</I>. Sinners are  disordered in two ways in their desire. First, by contempt of God. Second,  by an inordinate love for temporal things.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Quantum ad primum dicit, <I>Deum non invocaverunt</I> propter duo. Primo  quia in Deum non credunt. <I>Rom. 10: Quomodo invocabunt in quem non  crediderunt</I>? Secundo quia credunt sibi per se sufficere.<I> Ps. 11:  Labia nostra a nobis sunt</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>He  says, with respect to the first, <I>They have not called on God</I>, for  two reasons. First, because they do not believe in God - <I>Romans 10: How  then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? </I>And  second, because they believe themselves to suffice unto themselves -  <I>Psalm 11: Our lips are our own.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Quantum ad secundum dicit, <I>Illic trepidaverunt ubi non fuit  timor</I>; quasi dicat: Ex hac causa timuerunt ubi non est timendum. Verbo  <I>Illic</I> non locum sed causam designat. Unde dicit Augustinus quod  timor ex amore causatur. 
<td style=text-align:justify>He  says, with respect to the second, <I>There they have trembled for fear  where there was no fear</I>, as if to say, "Out of that cause, they feared  where there was nothing to be feared. The word, <I>There</I>, does not  designate a place, but the cause. For this reason Augustine says that fear  is caused by love. 
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Isti, scilicet mali, vel peccatores, non nisi temporalium amorem habent;  et ideo solum damna temporalia timent, idest, propter illam causam ubi non  est, idest, propter quod non timendum.
<td style=text-align:justify>Those people, namely the evil, do not have any love unless it be of  temporal things; and for this reason, the only thing they fear is temporal  damages, that is, on account of that cause where it is not, that is, on  account of that which is not be feared.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Matth. 10: Nolite timere eos</I>, etc.; et ideo non est timendum in  amissione temporalium, quia in ipsis non est proprie verum bonum nostrum,  et certum est quod si adhaereremus Deo etiam hoc dabit nobis. <I>Matth. 6:  Primum quaerite regnum Dei</I>, etc..
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Matthew 10: Therefore fear them not</I>. etc. And therefore one is  not to fear the loss of temporal goods, for our true good is not actually  in those things, and it is assured that if we stick to God, he will give  it to us - <I>Matthew 6: Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God</I>,  etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>g.</B> <I>Quoniam Dominus dissipavit</I>. Hic manifestat quaestionem  quomodo correctio fiat, idest propter poenam. Et inducit duplicem poenam,  scilicet interiorem et exteriorem. Primum ostendit cum dicit, <I>Deus  dissipavit ossa eorum qui hominibus placent</I>, idest qui finaliter  desiderant hominibus placere. 
<td style=text-align:justify><I>For the Lord hath scattered</I>. Here he reveals the question as to  what way the correction shall be done, that is, on account of punishment.  And he brings up two kinds of punishment, namely interior and exterior. He  indicates the first when he says <I>God has scattered the bones of them  that please men</I>, that is, those who in the end desire to please  men.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Per  ossa intelligitur fortitudo. Haec autem fortitudo omnis (vel) est  corporalis, et haec consumitur a Deo; (vel) est spiritualis, et haec  consumitur per peccatum. Haec ossa sunt virtutes bonorum virorum; unde in  cruce ossa Christi non fuerunt fracta. Sed latronum ossa fuerunt contrita.  
<td style=text-align:justify>By  "bones", "courage" is understood. But such courage of each person is  either bodily, and this kind is consumed by God, or it is spiritual, and  this kind is consumed by sin. These bones are the virtues of good men; so,  while he was on the cross, Christ's bones were not broken. But the bones  of the robbers were crushed.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sed  dicit, <I>eorum qui hominibus placent</I>. Numquid placere hominibus est  pravum? Videtur quod non. <I>1. Cor. 10: Sine offensione estote,</I> etc..  Item <I>Omnibus per omnia placeo</I>, dicit Apostolus.
<td style=text-align:justify>But  he says, <I>Them that please men</I>. But is it always a wicked thing to  please men? It appears not - <I>1 Corinthians 10: Be without  offence</I>.<I> </I>And again, the Apostle says, " I also in all things  please all men."
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dicendum, quod si aliquis velit placere alicui propter inanem gloriam,  sive gloriam humanam habendam hoc est pravum in illis qui in hoc ponunt  finem, quia tales confidenter peccant in occulto dummodo placeant in  aperto. 
<td style=text-align:justify>It  is to be said that, if somebody wills to please somebody else on account  of empty glory, or on account that he should have human glory, this is a  wicked thing in those who place their goal in it, because such people  boldly sin secretly at the same time that they openly please.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Aliquando autem aliquis vult aliis placere ut trahat eos ad Deum; et sic  talis placentia est meritoria et bona; et sic volebat Apostolus nos aliis  placere, et sic placebat ipse. 
<td style=text-align:justify>But,  at some time somebody wills to please some other people so that he draws  them to God; and so such a pleasing is meritorious and good; and so the  Apostle wills to please us, and in such manner he did please.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Contrarium ponitur poena exterior: unde dicit, <I>Confusi sunt</I>,  idest confundantur, quia peccata eorum deteguntur. <I>Job 20 : Revelabunt  caeli iniquitatem eius, </I>quia deceperunt, et quia perdent temporalia  per quae credebant habere felicitatem<I>. Jer. 20: Confundentur  vehementer. Jer.17: Confundentur qui me persequuntur</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>The  exterior punishment is set down in the opposite way: where he says,  <I>They have been confounded</I>, that is "let them be confounded",  because their sins are discovered - <I>Job 20:</I> <I>The heavens shall  reveal his iniquity</I>, because they have deceived, and because they will  lose those temporal things through which they believed they would have  happiness - <I>Jeremias 20:</I> <I>They shall be greatly confounded;  Jeremias 17: Let them be confounded that persecute me.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  hoc patientur <I>Quoniam Deus sprevit eos</I>. Illi sunt honorati quos  Deus amat. <I>Psalm.138: Nimis</I> <I>honorati [honorificati] sunt</I>,  etc.; sed quos Deus sprevit <I>Sunt confusi</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  they suffer this<I> because God hath despised them</I>. Those who God  loves are honored - <I>Psalm 138: But to me thy friends, O God, are made  exceedingly honourable</I>.<I> </I>But those who God despised <I>Have been  confounded</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>h.</B> <I>Quis dabit ex Sion</I>? Hic agit de bonis. Et primo  proponitur quaestio. Secundo responsio.
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Who will give out of Sion</I>? Here, it is a matter concerning the  good. So, first, he sets out the question. Second, the  response.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Quaestio est talis. Quis ex Sion procedens salvabit Israel? Quis?  Christus quia salus ex Iudaeis est: Ergo ex Sion, idest ex Iudaeis, et ex  David, et ex coenaculo Sion ubi Apostoli spiritum sanctum receperunt,  processerunt praedicatores salutis. Et haec non dabit nisi Deus.
<td style=text-align:justify>The  question is of this sort. "Who, coming out of Sion, shall save Israel?"  Who? Christ, because salvation is from the Jews: therefore out of Sion,  that is, from the Jews, and from David, and from the eating room [of the  Last Supper] in Sion, where the Apostles received the Holy Spirit, those  who proclaimed salvation. And no one but God will give this. 
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  qualiter? Quando converterit captivitatem plebis suae. Nam plebs fidelis  in captivitate, idest in carcere Diaboli tenebatur quam convertit Deus  quando eam relaxavit. <I>Ps. 125 : Converte, Domine, captivitatem  nostram,</I> etc..
<td style=text-align:justify>And  how so? When he has converted the captivity of his people. The faithful  people in captivity, that is, who have been held in the prison of the  Devil, and whom God converts when he releases them - <I>Psalm 125: Turn  again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south</I>.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  quid sequetur ex hoc? Gaudium et laetitia. <I>Ps .125: In convertendo  Dominum captivitatem (Sion) facti sumus,</I> etc. Sed est duplex status  fidelium, scilicet luctae et coronae, meriti et praemii; et utrobique est  gaudium. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  what follows from this? Joy and gladness - <I>Psalm 125: When the Lord  brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.</I> But  the condition of faithful people is twofold, namely, of mourning and  glory, of merit and recompense; and on either side there is  joy.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  primum est gaudium de participatione gratiae. <I>Rom. 14: Regnum est  iustitia</I>. <I>[non est regnum Dei esca et potus sed iustitia].</I> Et  ideo dicit <I>Exultabit Iacob</I>.<I> 1 Reg. 2: Exultavit cor meum</I>,  etc.. In praemio est gaudium, dicit glossa. <I>Isaiae. 35</I>.<I> Laetitia  sempiterna</I>, etc.. Et ideo dicit, <I>Laetabitur Israel</I>. 
<td style=text-align:justify>And  first is the joy of participation in grace - <I>Romans 14: For the kingdom  of God is not meat and drink; but justice</I>.<I> </I>And thus he says  <I>Jacob shall rejoice - 1 Kings 2: My heart hath rejoiced in the  Lord</I>, etc. And there is joy in the reward, the gloss says - <I>Isaias  35: And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads</I>. And therefore he  says, <I>Israel shall rejoice</I>.</TABLE>
